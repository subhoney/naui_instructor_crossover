# Naui Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor

## 1. <a name='DiveSafetyThroughEducation'></a>Dive Safety Through Education

### 1.1. <a name='Introduction'></a>Introduction

Since its inception, NAUI members have earned a worldwide reputation for quality scuba leadership. Our organization has continued to attract the best minds in diving because of our continuing emphasis on quality. It is this reputation for excellence that likely contributed to your decision to seek membership. As a member, you will profit from this high public regard. You will also be expected to help maintain this reputation by working conscientiously to improve diving safety through education of others and through your personal commitment to continuing education. Few people are fortunate enough to earn a living doing what they love to do. Earning membership in NAUI will create opportunities to work in exotic locations and share your love of diving with a variety of people from all over the world.

### 1.2. <a name='NationalAssociationofUnderwaterInstructors'></a>National Association of Underwater Instructors

Unlike other diving certification organizations, NAUI is a worldwide, democratic, membership association dedicated to serving the public. NAUI is democratic in that our instructor members elect the Board of Directors, who represent the membership and establish policies and directions for our association. Our corporate mission statement is paraphrased as our stated purpose, which is “to enable people to enjoy underwater activities as safely as possible by providing the highest quality practical education, and to actively promote the preservation and protection of the world’s underwater environments.” Every person who becomes a NAUI member pledges him or herself to follow and to further this purpose.

When you earn a NAUI leadership rating and join the Association, you will gain the rights and privileges of membership appropriate to your level. Along with these rights, you assume responsibilities as detailed in the NAUI Standards and Policies Manual. As a leadership candidate, you should be thoroughly familiar with the information in this manual, and especially with the sections on NAUI Ethics and the NAUI Credo. Both will help you understand what NAUI means to its members. Our Association thrives on the diversity and enthusiasm that each new member brings to every level. The discoveries, innovations, ideas, and camaraderie you will share with other members are fundamental to NAUI’s strength and preeminence within the diving community.
Desire alone does not ensure NAUI leadership certification. The training is a challenging process of growth and self-discovery; receiving your NAUI certificate will be a noteworthy success. It will mean that you have performed to the very limit of your ability, and that you are committed to doing so throughout your career as a diving leader.

The Membership Agreement you will be asked to read and sign when you join is an example of how seriously NAUI members take their responsibility to maintain the Association’s reputation and high quality service to divers and students. It asks you to grant our Membership Review Committee the right to investigate and recommend disciplinary action if you do not behave professionally as a member and abide by NAUI’s Code of Ethics. You will be expected to follow and support the collective will and mind of the membership as expressed in our Standards and Policies Manual. This obligation also includes, however, the freedom to define how to best fulfill leadership responsibilities and develop your own professional style and teaching methods. Members’ individuality and unique contributions are highly valued.

### 1.3. <a name='NAUILeadershipTraining'></a>NAUI Leadership Training

The primary goal of NAUI leadership training is to help you become a valuable member and as successful a diving leader as you can be. This training has four aspects:

1. Acquiring diving knowledge and developing the ability to perform and demonstrate specific essential water skills.
1. Learning leadership skills and developing an effective personal leadership style through study and the observation of other leaders.
1. Benefiting from evaluation and coaching on all aspects of leadership responsibilities.
   Gaining experience through exercising leadership skills under the supervision and guidance of a NAUI Instructor.

### 1.4. <a name='DevelopingLeaders'></a>Developing Leaders

No one can make a leader, but there are traits associated with the display of leadership. Training can help you identify and develop these traits within yourself. Once identified and understood, it will be your responsibility to nurture these qualities as you progress in leadership training throughout your career as a NAUI member and professional diver. NAUI leadership training will give you the tools that will enable you to develop your own techniques for working more effectively with divers, but you will develop your leadership ability in accord with your own personality, values, and style.

### 1.5. <a name='PersonalLeadershipStylesandValues'></a>Personal Leadership Styles and Values

Our conscious behavior is based upon our values and personality. Value (the worth that we ascribe to anything) derives from what we learn by observing our families, friends, culture, and world experience as filtered through our personalities. Personality is the sum of our talents, predisposition and experiences. We learn a great deal by observing the behavior of others, some of which we adapt to our personal style. But, as we evolve and become more confident and mature, we also reject some behaviors as unsuitable and undesirable.

Attitudes (how we feel about things) govern our behavior. The development of an appropriate system of values and proper leadership attitudes is as vital to meeting membership responsibility as the acquisition of knowledge and skills.

The process of leadership training is a continuation of your development as an individual. You will learn that observation, reflection, insight, and realization are as important to the process as study. You will become your version of a leader through a process of assimilation, adapting and modifying everything you learn. Some facets of your trainers’ leadership styles may impress you. Some of their techniques will be valuable as examples of effective leadership skills. However, not all of their styles or techniques may work for you. More important than picking up “tricks of the trade” is working in a leadership program that will show you how established members meet their leadership responsibilities.

Like all NAUI leaders, you will regularly deal with the lives and well being of students and divers. You must develop an attitude that places concern for their safety at the highest level. Minimally competent divers are urged to improve in the same way that NAUI leaders are charged to constantly improve their own competence. Published minimum standards of achievement are treated as goals to be acquired and exceeded. NAUI leaders find satisfaction and enjoyment in inspiring divers to develop well beyond the minimum standards.

### 1.6. <a name='NAUIValuesofLeadershipandInstruction'></a>NAUI Values of Leadership and Instruction

#### 1.6.1. <a name='SuperiorLeadershipandInstructorTraining'></a>Superior Leadership and Instructor Training

NAUI and its members are committed to providing the highest quality leadership and instructor training possible. Embracing the tenets of over-learning, maximizing individual potential, public speaking, developing personal best aquatic skills, minimum and no impact environmental activism, and learning by doing consistently produces the best graduates.

#### 1.6.2. <a name='DemocraticAssociationofEquals'></a>Democratic Association of Equals

The democratic process in regular elections determines the Association’s leadership, its Board of Directors. Each instructor earns the privilege to cast one vote for a fellow member that he or she believes can best serve the Association. Because we all have the same right to directly influence the organization and no individual voting member exercises more or less than a single vote, each member’s views are equally important. The right to vote carries with it a responsibility and obligation to stay informed about Board of Director candidates and engage in the election process.

#### 1.6.3. <a name='TrustandRespect'></a>Trust and Respect

Superior leadership and instructor training are founded in the “Loved One” concept. That is, it is only those we would trust to train our loved ones to dive that we graduate at any level and especially so for leadership and instructor certification. This basis allows us to collectively trust members to behave ethically and respect their abilities as NAUI leaders and educators.

#### 1.6.4. <a name='AcademicFreedom'></a>Academic Freedom

Trust and respect are necessary for members to exercise a most cherished and fundamental right of educational leadership – the freedom to meet the academic needs of their students. NAUI members are encouraged to explore and thereby discover new and innovative ways to help each individual student, as well as divers they lead and teach meet certification requirements – and further to share those discoveries in the Association publications so that other members may benefit.

#### 1.6.5. <a name='DynamicGrowingBodyofKnowledgeandSkills'></a>Dynamic Growing Body of Knowledge and Skills

Exercising academic freedom and sharing resulting discoveries is a celebration of members’ imaginations. It also leads to ever improving training producing better generations of graduates with each completed course. This directly contributes to and renews our organization’s vitality and relevance to the diving industry in which we compete.

#### 1.6.6. <a name='EverImprovingLeadershipandInstructorTraining'></a>Ever Improving Leadership and Instructor Training

These dynamics produce perpetually improving leadership and instructor training courses as conducted by NAUI Instructors, Instructor Trainers, and Course Directors, who incorporate discoveries and new methodology. The outcome is superior leadership and instructor training and curricula of excellence that benefit the Association, the diving industry and global public all the while furthering the pursuit of the corporate mission.

### 1.7. <a name='TheNAUIMission'></a>The NAUI Mission

To promote, through quality education, the techniques necessary for the general public to participate safely in underwater activities, and to educate those people in the preservation and protection of our underwater environment throughout their diving careers.

Becoming a member of the National Association of Underwater Instructors is more than just joining a group with a reputation for quality. It is about embracing a set of values that transcend the mundane pursuit of a vocation. It is about becoming filled with a passion to achieve one’s personal best and helping other to achieve the same. It is about contributing to something larger than oneself and making the world a little better for having passed this way. NAUI members care deeply about diving, the aquatic environment and the safety of people who participate. You have chosen to accept a challenge that can be one of the most rewarding of your life and last an entire lifetime.

## 2. <a name='LeadershipFundamentals'></a>Leadership Fundamentals

### 2.1. <a name='Introduction-1'></a>Introduction

Effective leaders are excited about their jobs, welcoming the challenge that responsibility entails. They are able to reassess, reevaluate, and adjust to changing demands, adapting to situations to provide responsible guidance and support. And their competence and proficiency build group confidence.

The best leaders carefully plan and train for their roles, and are organized and punctual. Forethought helps them do their jobs professionally, consistently performing at their best. Participants in these leaders’ activities know what to expect and that contingencies have been anticipated, allowing them to relax and concentrate on their own goals.

Leaders regard difficult tasks as challenges, but the most able leaders understand, as well, that people live within their own personal limitations. Developing the maturity to face such limitations, without accepting them as excuses for failure, is a mark of true leadership character. Failures do not discourage leaders. They use them to strengthen their resolve to overcome and to learn from them. Others’ failures are treated with compassion and assistance.

### 2.2. <a name='NAUILeadership'></a>NAUI Leadership

The decision to seek NAUI leadership training begins with personal motivation – the will to act on ambition. The reasons vary by individual, but all who earn NAUI membership share the Association’s goals of promoting safer diving, helping the sport grow, and working to preserve the diving environment. They value excellence in these endeavors and find personal satisfaction in fulfilling the responsibility for continuing improvement embodied in their NAUI certification.

The unique challenges of diving leadership, however, and NAUI’s dedication to Dive Safety Through Education, place special emphasis on the fundamentals of: knowledge, experience, and ability.

Contact with NAUI leaders has likely given you some insight into this, and into the added realization that each leader embodies a personal set of leadership characteristics. Thus, there is no formula that can ensure your success as a NAUI leader, other than your willingness to strive to be the best you can be.

NAUI leaders are typically dynamic, goal-oriented individuals, and display flexibility and resourcefulness. Such people welcome suggestions for improvement and work hard to build consensus, although never compromising or negotiating matters of safety, conservation, or NAUI standards. Groups respect their judgment and integrity, as well as their conscientious and caring attitude. NAUI members welcome questions as opportunities to educate, not as challenges to authority. They consider other viewpoints, and are open to learning from anyone.

They are notable for their involved objectivity; they simultaneously care about the well being of others, while observing and helping with their difficulties and concerns.
Personal example is one of a NAUI member’s strongest and most reliable communication tools. Despite their position of authority and control, members strive to be polite and reasonable, and work to ensure their personal manner is usually engaging and approachable. They take care in their speech and actions, understanding that even personal grooming will have an effect on other persons’ perception of them as a leader.

The best NAUI leaders seem to have a certain humility about themselves and their achievements. Although one can often identify the leader in a group, it is generally not because the leader wears jacket patches, or demands attention. Rather it’s “just something” about the person’s demeanor and personality that makes their status clear.

Your success as a NAUI leader will depend directly on your efforts to become one. Concentrating on the three concrete aspects that your training – knowledge, experience, and ability – will address and build the necessary foundation.

### 2.3. <a name='Knowledge'></a>Knowledge

Knowledge and the ability to communicate it are fundamental to exercising leadership. NAUI leadership status requires substantial, comprehensive knowledge of the various disciplines of scuba diving, from physiology to physics, mechanics to mathematics.

The high regard NAUI members place on knowledge is further emphasized by the requirement that those who join continue formal training in the fields of diving, diving safety, and the aquatic environment in order to maintain active status.

Knowledge is gained through formal study, practice and experience, but everyone absorbs information in their own way. While some can read and understand difficult concepts or formulae effortlessly, others must sometimes find alternative ways to learn.

### 2.4. <a name='Experience'></a>Experience

No amount of study or your instructor’s communications skill can substitute for actual guided practice– for scuba diving or leadership. Discussing and reading about an activity are not equivalent to participation. Too often people confuse a knowledgeable background with real experience.

The experience you will gain under your instructor’s guidance will increase your knowledge, diving ability, and understanding of NAUI leadership, and help you integrate what you have learned in the past. Your leadership training will also include real responsibilities, as well as simulations and practice scenarios. All will be aimed at giving you experience that will enable you to develop leadership judgment, the ability to make good diving decisions for yourself and others.

Regardless, of past training, you will still make errors during your leadership training. This is perfectly natural, albeit discouraging at times, especially during formal evaluations. The key to dealing wisely with errors is to learn from yours and those of others.

### 2.5. <a name='Ability'></a>Ability

Ability denotes the capacity of an individual to perform a task or demonstrate a skill. NAUI training will help you acquire and refine leadership-level practical abilities, develop good technique, and the know-how to assess and correct flaws in others’ diving skills.

Whatever certification level we hold, our status as NAUI members makes us highly visible and influential. Divers closely observe, and many seek to emulate all of our behavior, as well as diving competence. You must be able to meet this role model responsibility for the divers you will lead. More subtly, and perhaps ultimately more important, personal attributes and character will determine your success at developing this ability in your pursuit of leadership certification.

## Working as a NAUI Member

### Introduction

NAUI leaders are in demand in every recreational diving setting around the globe. They work full-time year-round, part-time, evenings, weekends, and seasonally. They are self-employed or employed at local clubs and dive stores, colleges, dive resorts, and summer camps. They live and work in exotic locales, aboard cruise liners, luxury yachts, research vessels, and in their hometowns.

The NAUI leadership role you are considering, or for which you are training, can be your entry to an exciting new life-style; or it may provide you with an expanded and rewarding dimension to your regular activities. The choice is yours as a NAUI Assistant Instructor, Skin Diving Instructor, Divemaster, or Instructor.

Dues paid NAUI leaders are all members of the Association, and have the right to display their leadership credentials. Each year, members are notified of annual dues and renewal requirements, and must comply in order to maintain their desired status – active, sustaining, or emeritus. Through the strength of our Association, members may obtain liability insurance appropriate to their certification level and status.
