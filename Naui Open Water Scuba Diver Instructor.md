# Naui Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor

## 1. <a name='DiveSafetyThroughEducation'></a>Dive Safety Through Education

### 1.1. <a name='Introduction'></a>Introduction

Since its inception, NAUI members have earned a worldwide reputation for quality scuba leadership. Our organization has continued to attract the best minds in diving because of our continuing emphasis on quality. It is this reputation for excellence that likely contributed to your decision to seek membership. As a member, you will profit from this high public regard. You will also be expected to help maintain this reputation by working conscientiously to improve diving safety through education of others and through your personal commitment to continuing education. Few people are fortunate enough to earn a living doing what they love to do. Earning membership in NAUI will create opportunities to work in exotic locations and share your love of diving with a variety of people from all over the world.

### 1.2. <a name='NationalAssociationofUnderwaterInstructors'></a>National Association of Underwater Instructors

Unlike other diving certification organizations, NAUI is a worldwide, democratic, membership association dedicated to serving the public. NAUI is democratic in that our instructor members elect the Board of Directors, who represent the membership and establish policies and directions for our association. Our corporate mission statement is paraphrased as our stated purpose, which is “to enable people to enjoy underwater activities as safely as possible by providing the highest quality practical education, and to actively promote the preservation and protection of the world’s underwater environments.” Every person who becomes a NAUI member pledges him or herself to follow and to further this purpose.

When you earn a NAUI leadership rating and join the Association, you will gain the rights and privileges of membership appropriate to your level. Along with these rights, you assume responsibilities as detailed in the NAUI Standards and Policies Manual. As a leadership candidate, you should be thoroughly familiar with the information in this manual, and especially with the sections on NAUI Ethics and the NAUI Credo. Both will help you understand what NAUI means to its members. Our Association thrives on the diversity and enthusiasm that each new member brings to every level. The discoveries, innovations, ideas, and camaraderie you will share with other members are fundamental to NAUI’s strength and preeminence within the diving community.
Desire alone does not ensure NAUI leadership certification. The training is a challenging process of growth and self-discovery; receiving your NAUI certificate will be a noteworthy success. It will mean that you have performed to the very limit of your ability, and that you are committed to doing so throughout your career as a diving leader.

The Membership Agreement you will be asked to read and sign when you join is an example of how seriously NAUI members take their responsibility to maintain the Association’s reputation and high quality service to divers and students. It asks you to grant our Membership Review Committee the right to investigate and recommend disciplinary action if you do not behave professionally as a member and abide by NAUI’s Code of Ethics. You will be expected to follow and support the collective will and mind of the membership as expressed in our Standards and Policies Manual. This obligation also includes, however, the freedom to define how to best fulfill leadership responsibilities and develop your own professional style and teaching methods. Members’ individuality and unique contributions are highly valued.

### 1.3. <a name='NAUILeadershipTraining'></a>NAUI Leadership Training

The primary goal of NAUI leadership training is to help you become a valuable member and as successful a diving leader as you can be. This training has four aspects:

1. Acquiring diving knowledge and developing the ability to perform and demonstrate specific essential water skills.
1. Learning leadership skills and developing an effective personal leadership style through study and the observation of other leaders.
1. Benefiting from evaluation and coaching on all aspects of leadership responsibilities.
   Gaining experience through exercising leadership skills under the supervision and guidance of a NAUI Instructor.

### 1.4. <a name='DevelopingLeaders'></a>Developing Leaders

No one can make a leader, but there are traits associated with the display of leadership. Training can help you identify and develop these traits within yourself. Once identified and understood, it will be your responsibility to nurture these qualities as you progress in leadership training throughout your career as a NAUI member and professional diver. NAUI leadership training will give you the tools that will enable you to develop your own techniques for working more effectively with divers, but you will develop your leadership ability in accord with your own personality, values, and style.

### 1.5. <a name='PersonalLeadershipStylesandValues'></a>Personal Leadership Styles and Values

Our conscious behavior is based upon our values and personality. Value (the worth that we ascribe to anything) derives from what we learn by observing our families, friends, culture, and world experience as filtered through our personalities. Personality is the sum of our talents, predisposition and experiences. We learn a great deal by observing the behavior of others, some of which we adapt to our personal style. But, as we evolve and become more confident and mature, we also reject some behaviors as unsuitable and undesirable.

Attitudes (how we feel about things) govern our behavior. The development of an appropriate system of values and proper leadership attitudes is as vital to meeting membership responsibility as the acquisition of knowledge and skills.

The process of leadership training is a continuation of your development as an individual. You will learn that observation, reflection, insight, and realization are as important to the process as study. You will become your version of a leader through a process of assimilation, adapting and modifying everything you learn. Some facets of your trainers’ leadership styles may impress you. Some of their techniques will be valuable as examples of effective leadership skills. However, not all of their styles or techniques may work for you. More important than picking up “tricks of the trade” is working in a leadership program that will show you how established members meet their leadership responsibilities.

Like all NAUI leaders, you will regularly deal with the lives and well being of students and divers. You must develop an attitude that places concern for their safety at the highest level. Minimally competent divers are urged to improve in the same way that NAUI leaders are charged to constantly improve their own competence. Published minimum standards of achievement are treated as goals to be acquired and exceeded. NAUI leaders find satisfaction and enjoyment in inspiring divers to develop well beyond the minimum standards.

### 1.6. <a name='NAUIValuesofLeadershipandInstruction'></a>NAUI Values of Leadership and Instruction

#### 1.6.1. <a name='SuperiorLeadershipandInstructorTraining'></a>Superior Leadership and Instructor Training

NAUI and its members are committed to providing the highest quality leadership and instructor training possible. Embracing the tenets of over-learning, maximizing individual potential, public speaking, developing personal best aquatic skills, minimum and no impact environmental activism, and learning by doing consistently produces the best graduates.

#### 1.6.2. <a name='DemocraticAssociationofEquals'></a>Democratic Association of Equals

The democratic process in regular elections determines the Association’s leadership, its Board of Directors. Each instructor earns the privilege to cast one vote for a fellow member that he or she believes can best serve the Association. Because we all have the same right to directly influence the organization and no individual voting member exercises more or less than a single vote, each member’s views are equally important. The right to vote carries with it a responsibility and obligation to stay informed about Board of Director candidates and engage in the election process.

#### 1.6.3. <a name='TrustandRespect'></a>Trust and Respect

Superior leadership and instructor training are founded in the “Loved One” concept. That is, it is only those we would trust to train our loved ones to dive that we graduate at any level and especially so for leadership and instructor certification. This basis allows us to collectively trust members to behave ethically and respect their abilities as NAUI leaders and educators.

#### 1.6.4. <a name='AcademicFreedom'></a>Academic Freedom

Trust and respect are necessary for members to exercise a most cherished and fundamental right of educational leadership – the freedom to meet the academic needs of their students. NAUI members are encouraged to explore and thereby discover new and innovative ways to help each individual student, as well as divers they lead and teach meet certification requirements – and further to share those discoveries in the Association publications so that other members may benefit.

#### 1.6.5. <a name='DynamicGrowingBodyofKnowledgeandSkills'></a>Dynamic Growing Body of Knowledge and Skills

Exercising academic freedom and sharing resulting discoveries is a celebration of members’ imaginations. It also leads to ever improving training producing better generations of graduates with each completed course. This directly contributes to and renews our organization’s vitality and relevance to the diving industry in which we compete.

#### 1.6.6. <a name='EverImprovingLeadershipandInstructorTraining'></a>Ever Improving Leadership and Instructor Training

These dynamics produce perpetually improving leadership and instructor training courses as conducted by NAUI Instructors, Instructor Trainers, and Course Directors, who incorporate discoveries and new methodology. The outcome is superior leadership and instructor training and curricula of excellence that benefit the Association, the diving industry and global public all the while furthering the pursuit of the corporate mission.

### 1.7. <a name='TheNAUIMission'></a>The NAUI Mission

To promote, through quality education, the techniques necessary for the general public to participate safely in underwater activities, and to educate those people in the preservation and protection of our underwater environment throughout their diving careers.

Becoming a member of the National Association of Underwater Instructors is more than just joining a group with a reputation for quality. It is about embracing a set of values that transcend the mundane pursuit of a vocation. It is about becoming filled with a passion to achieve one’s personal best and helping other to achieve the same. It is about contributing to something larger than oneself and making the world a little better for having passed this way. NAUI members care deeply about diving, the aquatic environment and the safety of people who participate. You have chosen to accept a challenge that can be one of the most rewarding of your life and last an entire lifetime.

## 2. <a name='LeadershipFundamentals'></a>Leadership Fundamentals

### 2.1. <a name='Introduction-1'></a>Introduction

Effective leaders are excited about their jobs, welcoming the challenge that responsibility entails. They are able to reassess, reevaluate, and adjust to changing demands, adapting to situations to provide responsible guidance and support. And their competence and proficiency build group confidence.

The best leaders carefully plan and train for their roles, and are organized and punctual. Forethought helps them do their jobs professionally, consistently performing at their best. Participants in these leaders’ activities know what to expect and that contingencies have been anticipated, allowing them to relax and concentrate on their own goals.

Leaders regard difficult tasks as challenges, but the most able leaders understand, as well, that people live within their own personal limitations. Developing the maturity to face such limitations, without accepting them as excuses for failure, is a mark of true leadership character. Failures do not discourage leaders. They use them to strengthen their resolve to overcome and to learn from them. Others’ failures are treated with compassion and assistance.

### 2.2. <a name='NAUILeadership'></a>NAUI Leadership

The decision to seek NAUI leadership training begins with personal motivation – the will to act on ambition. The reasons vary by individual, but all who earn NAUI membership share the Association’s goals of promoting safer diving, helping the sport grow, and working to preserve the diving environment. They value excellence in these endeavors and find personal satisfaction in fulfilling the responsibility for continuing improvement embodied in their NAUI certification.

The unique challenges of diving leadership, however, and NAUI’s dedication to Dive Safety Through Education, place special emphasis on the fundamentals of: knowledge, experience, and ability.

Contact with NAUI leaders has likely given you some insight into this, and into the added realization that each leader embodies a personal set of leadership characteristics. Thus, there is no formula that can ensure your success as a NAUI leader, other than your willingness to strive to be the best you can be.

NAUI leaders are typically dynamic, goal-oriented individuals, and display flexibility and resourcefulness. Such people welcome suggestions for improvement and work hard to build consensus, although never compromising or negotiating matters of safety, conservation, or NAUI standards. Groups respect their judgment and integrity, as well as their conscientious and caring attitude. NAUI members welcome questions as opportunities to educate, not as challenges to authority. They consider other viewpoints, and are open to learning from anyone.

They are notable for their involved objectivity; they simultaneously care about the well being of others, while observing and helping with their difficulties and concerns.
Personal example is one of a NAUI member’s strongest and most reliable communication tools. Despite their position of authority and control, members strive to be polite and reasonable, and work to ensure their personal manner is usually engaging and approachable. They take care in their speech and actions, understanding that even personal grooming will have an effect on other persons’ perception of them as a leader.

The best NAUI leaders seem to have a certain humility about themselves and their achievements. Although one can often identify the leader in a group, it is generally not because the leader wears jacket patches, or demands attention. Rather it’s “just something” about the person’s demeanor and personality that makes their status clear.

Your success as a NAUI leader will depend directly on your efforts to become one. Concentrating on the three concrete aspects that your training – knowledge, experience, and ability – will address and build the necessary foundation.

### 2.3. <a name='Knowledge'></a>Knowledge

Knowledge and the ability to communicate it are fundamental to exercising leadership. NAUI leadership status requires substantial, comprehensive knowledge of the various disciplines of scuba diving, from physiology to physics, mechanics to mathematics.

The high regard NAUI members place on knowledge is further emphasized by the requirement that those who join continue formal training in the fields of diving, diving safety, and the aquatic environment in order to maintain active status.

Knowledge is gained through formal study, practice and experience, but everyone absorbs information in their own way. While some can read and understand difficult concepts or formulae effortlessly, others must sometimes find alternative ways to learn.

### 2.4. <a name='Experience'></a>Experience

No amount of study or your instructor’s communications skill can substitute for actual guided practice– for scuba diving or leadership. Discussing and reading about an activity are not equivalent to participation. Too often people confuse a knowledgeable background with real experience.

The experience you will gain under your instructor’s guidance will increase your knowledge, diving ability, and understanding of NAUI leadership, and help you integrate what you have learned in the past. Your leadership training will also include real responsibilities, as well as simulations and practice scenarios. All will be aimed at giving you experience that will enable you to develop leadership judgment, the ability to make good diving decisions for yourself and others.

Regardless, of past training, you will still make errors during your leadership training. This is perfectly natural, albeit discouraging at times, especially during formal evaluations. The key to dealing wisely with errors is to learn from yours and those of others.

### 2.5. <a name='Ability'></a>Ability

Ability denotes the capacity of an individual to perform a task or demonstrate a skill. NAUI training will help you acquire and refine leadership-level practical abilities, develop good technique, and the know-how to assess and correct flaws in others’ diving skills.

Whatever certification level we hold, our status as NAUI members makes us highly visible and influential. Divers closely observe, and many seek to emulate all of our behavior, as well as diving competence. You must be able to meet this role model responsibility for the divers you will lead. More subtly, and perhaps ultimately more important, personal attributes and character will determine your success at developing this ability in your pursuit of leadership certification.

## 3. <a name='WorkingasaNAUIMember'></a>Working as a NAUI Member

### 3.1. <a name='Introduction-1'></a>Introduction

NAUI leaders are in demand in every recreational diving setting around the globe. They work full-time year-round, part-time, evenings, weekends, and seasonally. They are self-employed or employed at local clubs and dive stores, colleges, dive resorts, and summer camps. They live and work in exotic locales, aboard cruise liners, luxury yachts, research vessels, and in their hometowns.

The NAUI leadership role you are considering, or for which you are training, can be your entry to an exciting new life-style; or it may provide you with an expanded and rewarding dimension to your regular activities. The choice is yours as a NAUI Assistant Instructor, Skin Diving Instructor, Divemaster, or Instructor.

Dues paid NAUI leaders are all members of the Association, and have the right to display their leadership credentials. Each year, members are notified of annual dues and renewal requirements, and must comply in order to maintain their desired status – active, sustaining, or emeritus. Through the strength of our Association, members may obtain liability insurance appropriate to their certification level and status.

### 3.2. <a name='NAUILeadershipTrainingPhysicalRequirements'></a>NAUI Leadership Training Physical Requirements

NAUI leadership training is a mentally and physically challenging process. All NAUI leadership candidates must have had a recent physical examination by a physician familiar with the demands of diving. The purpose of this exam is to help ensure that trainees face no undue personal risk or pose a risk to others by entering NAUI training and that they will likely be able to adequately discharge their responsibilities to help other divers when certified as NAUI leaders. NAUI leadership includes many physical tasks beyond swimming and diving ability. Helping students or divers through surf or currents, for instance, or having to render assistance or rescue divers when the need is apparent are basic leadership tasks.

While NAUI supports the policy of achieving consensus and respects the opinions of physicians, the final decision authority on an individual’s ability to participate in training courses or serve in a leadership position lies within our organization. When you become a NAUI leader, you will engage in the same fitness evaluation process with every individual with whom you work. Responsible diving leadership includes making certain that participants understand and fully assume the risks of their participation before a training or supervisory commitment is made.

### 3.3. <a name='NAUILeadershipPositions'></a>NAUI Leadership Positions

Each NAUI leadership position entitles holders to certain rights and privileges as a member, and each has different levels of appropriate activity and responsibility. All leadership roles demand adherence to NAUI’s Standards and Policies, and require superior ability and commitment to NAUI’s high ideals of professional and personal conduct.

As a NAUI member, you will be considered a role model for divers and students with whom you work. Fulfilling the responsibility to inspire and lead divers demands maturity, honesty, competence, judgment, ability and tact, and your personal commitment to add to NAUI’s reputation. Consider the impression your behavior will make, and realize that it will reflect upon all members of our Association, no matter what leadership role you perform.

### 3.4. <a name='TheNAUIAssistantInstructor'></a>The NAUI Assistant Instructor

A NAUI Assistant Instructor is qualified to help train skin and scuba divers under the direct supervision of an active-status NAUI Instructor. Although assistants are not permitted to teach skin or scuba diving independently, formally evaluate students for certification or assume sole responsibility for a diving class or students without an instructor present, they perform many valuable services in all phases of NAUI dive training.

Assistants enhance individual development and group safety, as well as-extend an instructor’s span of control by exercising additional vigilance, and can often alert instructors to students’ needs before they become problems.

Like all NAUI leaders, assistant instructors too must have superior water ability, and “demonstration quality” skills. They are frequently called upon to demonstrate proper techniques to dive students at an instructor’s request. Additionally, they must be completely prepared to serve as rescue divers, providing emergency assistance appropriate to their training.

Most assistant instructors aspire to become NAUI Instructors, and serving as an assistant is the most valuable “on-the-job training” available for this goal.

Assistant instructors certification, like all NAUI leadership ratings, carries great responsibility and commands respect in the diving community.

### 3.5. <a name='TheNAUISkinDivingInstructor'></a>The NAUI Skin Diving Instructor

A NAUI Skin Diving Instructor is qualified to independently teach and certify skin diving students, and may register graduates for skin diver certification credentials upon their meeting current NAUI standards. Scuba-certified skin diving instructors may also serve as assistant instructors during NAUI scuba courses, subject to the same activity limitations as other qualified assistants. Skin diving instructors may not teach scuba diving on their own.

NAUI Skin Diving Instructors have the opportunity to promote underwater enjoyment and aquatic conservation to a much wider audience than scuba alone can reach, and can significantly contribute to NAUI’s mission.

### 3.6. <a name='TheNAUIDivemaster'></a>The NAUI Divemaster

A NAUI Divemaster is qualified to organize and supervise dives for certified divers, and may also assist NAUI Instructors during certification training.

While Divemasters may neither teach courses nor issue diving certifications, they have a wide area within which they can gain personal rewards and contribute to NAUI’s mission. NAUI Divemasters are authorized to conduct NAUI Recognition Programs for certified divers, and award recognition materials, including cards and certificates.

Divemasters frequently pursue diving careers as activity leaders or underwater guides. While directing recreational diving activities in virtually every imaginable setting, NAUI Divemasters regularly deal with certified individuals from every agency and every part of the world.

Their main role is to promote, plan, organize and conduct recreational diving activities for certified individuals and groups.

### 3.7. <a name='TheInstructorPath'></a>The Instructor Path

Many individuals enter leadership training with the eventual goal of becoming NAUI scuba instructors. Earning a NAUI leadership position is fundamental preparation for a NAUI Instructor Training Course (ITC). As an instructor you are the key to the success of most diving businesses who need well-trained motivated students and divers to be enthusiastic and satisfied customers.

A NAUI Instructor certification presents limitless opportunity. Post instructor training and continued personal development is also an option after gaining some teaching experience.

## 4. <a name='Divemastering'></a>Divemastering

### 4.1. <a name='Introduction-1'></a>Introduction

NAUI Divemasters organize and oversee dives for certified recreational divers. Enjoying challenging work in every facet of recreational diving, divemasters wield great influence and can do much to help divers make better decisions about their diving activities.

Divemasters may operate as independent dive professionals or serve as diving staff members at schools, universities, dive stores, or clubs. They can plan, organize, promote, and lead local and vacation dive excursions in any of these situations. Divemasters assisting NAUI Instructors are considered “qualified” assistants for staffing ratios as detailed in the NAUI Standards and Policies Manual. Regardless of their actual position, divemasters are NAUI leaders in every sense; highly responsible individuals whose training qualifies them to render assistance in any diving incident. Divemasters may have to “save” a dive with spare gear, timely advice, or counseling, or if called upon in a diving emergency, may literally save a diver’s life.

### 4.2. <a name='ADivemastersAuthority'></a>A Divemaster's Authority

NAUI Divemasters regularly assume serious responsibilities overseeing divers, although they are neither “dive bosses,” nor “diving supervisors.” The authority of a NAUI Divemaster is usually grounded solely in the diving community’s respect for NAUI, and for the individual’s evident competency as a highly-trained, expert diver.

#### 4.2.1. <a name='Duty'></a>Duty

Like all NAUI leaders, divemasters are professionals rather than recreational divers. In particular divemaster certification means having earned the qualifications to assume independent leadership. This can imply responsibility for peoples’ lives. Such status in some areas of the world carries the legal duty to conduct professional activities in a proficient, responsible manner. This includes making a proactive commitment to maintaining and enhancing one’s personal diving and rescue skills and leadership ability through practice, regular continuing education, and professional development.

#### 4.2.2. <a name='Responsibility'></a>Responsibility

NAUI Divemasters rely on their own judgment, experience, and professionalism when assuming direct responsibility for certified divers. Because of the broad scope of recreational diving activities in which divemasters operate, NAUI Standards do not specify how many divers a divemaster can manage. The answer to this question for each diving situation depends upon many factors. Some of the variables are:

- The training and experience of the participants.
- The dive site, environmental conditions, and weather.
- The demands of the planned diving activity.
- The number and quality of people assisting.
- Personal knowledge of the participants and their diving abilities.

This wide latitude confers a correspondingly high obligation for NAUI Divemasters to exercise sound, conservative judgment. The maximum number of participants for any activity must be based on how many divers can be reasonably handled with the level of care expected of a NAUI leader. Thus, the most important element in deciding what constitutes a reasonable number of divers is the actual level of ability the divemaster brings to each unique situation. There will obviously be times when anyone would recognize they need help, and there will be other situations that are more equivocal. Judgment gained through NAUI leadership training and experience helps divemasters analyze situations, assess risks, and respond appropriately.

Safety and professional responsibility are the ultimate criteria for all NAUI diving activities. This can sometimes mean dividing groups and staggering dive times to reduce the number of people in the water at any given time or advising less accomplished divers against participating. Though correct, such decisions can be unpopular or financially detrimental. Despite these consequences, a divemaster’s greatest satisfaction comes from knowing that the last diver in any group has safely exited the water.

### 4.3. <a name='DivemasterSkills'></a>Divemaster Skills

NAUI Divemasters must be highly accomplished divers and extremely effective leaders. Possessing excellent personal diving ability, “demonstration quality skills,” rescue training, and comprehensive diving knowledge are only the beginning characteristics. Divemasters must work to develop their “global awareness” and superior judgment. This should be augmented with outstanding communication skills in order to help divers avoid problems through individual counseling, fostering safety through achieving group consensus and managing risk. Simple but important techniques like remembering people’s names and being able to put them at ease can help divemasters direct activities without seeming overbearing. Also important is the ability to concentrate on the goal of safer diving and get along with people, despite disagreement or even dislike.

Divemasters must be expert at diving in the conditions in which they work. They should also be familiar with the accepted practices for activities in which divers with whom they work may engage, whether or not they participate themselves. They should also be familiar with most diving equipment. They may need additional training in specialized areas such as technical diving, air compressor operation and maintenance, breathing gas cylinders, and filling/gas blending equipment. They may even need to become qualified equipment technicians or marine mechanics to be effective in some jobs.

All divemasters will find good planning, organizational skills, and record-keeping ability important to their role, especially if operating independently. As NAUI members, divemasters can take advantage of a variety of educational benefits available through their local NAUI Representatives, Service Centers, and the Association.

### 4.4. <a name='AssistingDivers'></a>Assisting Divers

NAUI Divemasters, working independently or as assistants, must be able to:

- Conduct pre-dive briefings that incisively cover hazards and risk avoidance.
- Conduct appropriate pre-dive equipment checks.
- Help divers perform weighting/buoyancy checks.
- Help divers prevent or resolve problems.
- Guide certified divers at the surface and underwater.
- Effectively manage or personally respond to diving emergencies.

Clearly, the most difficult and important of these tasks is acquiring and maintaining the knowledge and ability necessary to competently assist a distressed or injured diver. The proper response to any situation will be dictated by a rapid on-site assessment, and all divemasters must be mentally and physically prepared to determine and render appropriate aid. To be able to do this, they must commit to learning and repeatedly practicing emergency response skills throughout their careers.

#### 4.4.1. <a name='OrganizingandAssemblingDivers'></a>Organizing and Assembling Divers

A great deal of a divemaster’s leadership effort goes into the simple logistics of organizing and assembling divers. Much of this takes place before a diving event. Directions for rendezvous, travel arrangements and costs, departure and return times, necessary lodging and meal recommendations, and any particular documents or fees, such as for area admissions, boat rides, or equipment rental should all be communicated to participants well in advance. Divemasters are also usually responsible for imparting site information, such as any “house rules” for boats, beaches, or other areas and conducting dive briefings and debriefings at the event.

#### 4.4.2. <a name='RecordKeeping'></a>Record Keeping

Divemasters should maintain good records of diving activities they conduct. It is required that such records be kept for a period of five years. This includes the dive rosters, activity and personal information – such as names, certification levels and agencies, addresses, ages, emergency contact, and medical insurance information – for all participants.

While divers should be advised to maintain their own records of diving activities, they often depend on the divemaster log as a source of post-dive information that they can then transcribe to their personal log. Divemasters are also frequently asked to sign logbooks as witnesses. They are strongly advised to read such items carefully before signing and to refrain from endorsing questionable or incomplete entries.

#### 4.4.3. <a name='EquipmentandProcedures'></a>Equipment and Procedures

Divemasters should develop checklists of mandatory and recommended equipment for diving activities. The divemaster’s goal should be to ensure that divers are equipped to safely enjoy the dive.

### 4.5. <a name='BeingaDivemaster'></a>Being a Divemaster

Since no two diving experiences are exactly the same, only considered judgment and experience can guide a divemaster in any specific situation. A helpful, out-going manner and competent leadership behavior at a dive site accompanied by superior ability in the water will help ensure success.

Little details, like having plentiful drinking water available, or distributing fruit or candy to divers after they have unsuited can help a personal reputation, but conducting safe and enjoyable dives is more the issue.

In practice, the divemaster job rarely ends when all the divers have safely exited the water. There are still many clean-up and other tasks that need attention. These can include checking in rental equipment, filling cylinders, organizing and collecting weights, maintaining gear, developing photos, washing down the boat, and virtually anything else that needs doing. Divemasters are likely among the first to arrive at every dive event, and often the last to leave. In resort areas, it is often said that divemasters work “from dawn till done.”

Divemasters are vital to NAUI’s success and are important contributors to safer diving.

## 5. <a name='PreparingforanITC'></a>Preparing for an ITC

### 5.1. <a name='Introduction-1'></a>Introduction

Completing the NAUI leadership training progression and becoming an instructor is a thrilling challenge. Certification as a NAUI Instructor confers the right to train and certify the public in scuba, and subsequently in specialty areas as delineated in the NAUI Standards and Policies Manual. Instructors are also the only voting NAUI members, directly electing the Association’s Board of Directors, thus contributing to the evolution of NAUI’s guiding principles.

### 5.2. <a name='TheITCExperience'></a>The ITC Experience

ITCs vary in structure from accelerated nine or ten day courses to extended internships spanning a college semester or a full diving season. During the course, candidates are continually taught, tested, and assessed. Regardless of individual background, participants undergo careful evaluation and coaching on the physical and intellectual skills of scuba diving and instruction. During a typical course, swimming, skin and scuba diving skills, as well as academic diving knowledge, teaching techniques, effective public speaking and presentation are all practiced and appraised. Candidates focus on learning how to teach skills and information as well as perfecting “demonstration quality” personal diving skills. All are judged on their proficiency in presenting lessons and supervising others in the water and in a classroom. Attitude, motivation, character, creativity, and resourcefulness contribute to ratings. The process assesses and strengthens candidates’ every mental and physical ability.

### 5.3. <a name='TheMeasureofaNAUIInstructor'></a>The Measure of a NAUI Instructor

Completing prerequisite training courses can best develop the skills, knowledge, and attitudes necessary for success at a NAUI ITC. NAUI’s Master Scuba Diver Educational System is a convenient way to gain or review instructor level knowledge of diving academics. Candidates should also have developed polished, leadership quality diving skills and practical knowledge through extensive diving experience. Once thoroughly prepared, a candidate is ready to gain the most from the ITC. Without thorough earlier training and development, it is extremely difficult to successfully complete an ITC.

Even so, your ITC is only the beginning. Preparing to instruct and being a NAUI Instructor are ongoing processes that last throughout a career. Instructor status, as with other NAUI certifications, is just another step in your development as a diving leader and career as a NAUI member.

### 5.4. <a name='TimeandCommitment'></a>Time and Commitment

Success at a NAUI ITC requires extensive advance preparation, and your strong commitment to achievement. No one becomes a NAUI leader, let alone an instructor, casually. Dedication and commitment to purpose are fundamental to the process. You must be strongly motivated to attain instructor certification.

Sufficient time must be devoted for judgment to develop in an aspiring leader, and to develop the confidence, determination, and attitude you will need to carry you through the experience. Attending an ITC before one is fully ready is usually frustrating and counterproductive. While it is theoretically possible to progress from non-diver to diving instructor in a relatively short time, becoming a skilled leader is the result of an unhurried maturation and a long-term dedication to achieving goals. Individuals must judge their readiness in consultation with their own leaders.

### 5.5. <a name='Mentors'></a>Mentors

If you have participated in the progression of NAUI leadership certification courses, it is likely that you will have acquired a mentor, a trusted counselor or teacher. This individual will have inspired and guided you to the point where you feel ready to begin the process of becoming an instructor. Their wisdom and character should be an example and comfort to you, guiding you in your preparation.

### 5.6. <a name='Experience-1'></a>Experience

Experience is key to success at a NAUI ITC and as a NAUI Instructor. In recognition of this, NAUI Standards require a minimum number of logged dives to qualify for leadership training at each level, as well as minimum participation in NAUI classes.

Acquiring useful experience is seldom easy or free. It takes planning and judgment to select appropriate activities, time, and commitment to complete them, and help to properly evaluate and benefit from them. Training, experience, guided evaluation, and coaching are all elements of preparation that will contribute to your success.

### 5.7. <a name='Diving:QuantityandQuality'></a>Diving: Quantity and Quality

It is the depth of experience, not just the quantity of experience that prepares a person for successful completion of an ITC and for being an effective and capable teacher of divers.

Some NAUI Instructor Trainers and Course Directors recommend making a minimum of 100 dives in addition to dives completed during training before entering an ITC – far in excess of the minimum requirement. They may actually require such experience for entry into their leadership courses. NAUI Standards do not restrict members from establishing prerequisites in excess of published minimums. (These must be communicated to prospective enrollees before beginning training.) By doing so, they are underscoring the value of diving experience, and attempting to ensure their trainees’ success.

Having made 100 or even 1,000 dives at a few sites may not yield as useful experience as would be gained by making the minimum prerequisite dives at different places under varied conditions. However, dive sites needn’t be geographically distant or exotic to yield distinctive experiences. Variety can stem from planning different dive activities and objectives, during different seasons, or at different times of the day or night.

Participating in planning and executing even routine diving activities in a variety of circumstances is invaluable preparation and will increase your competence and confidence. Additionally, seek to vary the environments in which you dive. Experience in fresh and salt water, warm, temperate, and cool climates, and challenging conditions such as low-visibility or currents will further augment your skills and knowledge.

Practice all skills, including underwater navigation and search and recovery during day and night dives. Learn the skills of wreck penetration, deeper diving, and other specialty diving or aspects of technical diving. Experiences like these will prove valuable at your ITC and, more importantly, later, as you practice the craft of teaching diving.

Finally, realize that your goal requires that you don’t just make dives, no matter how many, but rather that you continually gain from them. Use every dive as a chance to perfect your skills, increase your ability and acquire knowledge. Debrief with your dive partner after every dive. Aspiring to professional diving instructor status requires professional level concentration on every dive.

### 5.8. <a name='SupervisedDivingExperience'></a>Supervised Diving Experience

Diving under supervision with specific training goals usually results in quality experience and increased diving acumen. Express your leadership ambition to individuals supervising any activities in which you participate. Regardless of their professional affiliation, most active diving leaders will be happy to provide feedback on your skills. Use such feedback (even from dive vacations or pleasure dives) to focus your pre-ITC preparation. The most profitable blend of supervised diving in formal training with recreational experience should be determined in consultation with your NAUI mentor.

### 5.9. <a name='ExperienceSupervisingandTeaching'></a>Experience Supervising and Teaching

Gaining experience supervising divers is just as important as your personal diving competence. Working with a NAUI Instructor is the single most effective way to develop adequate supervisory competence in preparation for a NAUI ITC. Earning certificates to teach other personal safety courses, such as CPR and First Aid, and conducting these classes, is good training for a potential NAUI Instructor and will make you more valuable when you are certified to teach scuba.

### 5.10. <a name='LeadershipWaterSkills'></a>Leadership Water Skills

No candidate without excellent diving skills can be successful at a NAUI ITC. In its most basic sense, “water skills” describes “demonstration quality” performance: comfortable, seemingly effortless skin and scuba diving.

NAUI leadership courses require participants to develop proficiency in a variety of general and diving-specific water skills. Current requirements are detailed in the NAUI Standards and Policies Manual, but they can be divided into various broad categories:

#### 5.10.1. <a name='Category1:SwimmingSkills'></a>Category #1: Swimming Skills

These are the basic swimming and assistance skills required for entry into a NAUI leadership course. They are performed without any scuba or skin diving equipment in a confined water environment.

#### 5.10.2. <a name='Category2:SkinDivingSkills'></a>Category #2: Skin Diving Skills

These require equipment: at least a wet suit jacket, a weight belt adjusted for proper buoyancy, mask, fins, snorkel, and BC. They may be performed in confined or suitable open water.

#### 5.10.3. <a name='Category3:ScubaDivingSkills'></a>Category #3: Scuba Diving Skills

These are performed in suitable confined water, wearing a complete scuba unit in addition to appropriate skin diving gear. Like the other categories, preparing to complete the scuba skills required for evaluation is a process of:

1. Breaking complex performances into component parts.
1. Practicing the parts under supervision that includes corrective review.
1. Becoming completely comfortable with each part through repetitive practice.
1. Polishing your performance to “demonstration quality.”

### 5.11. <a name='PreparatoryTraining'></a>Preparatory Training

Your success in a NAUI ITC will be directly related to the amount of leadership ability you have acquired through experience and formal training. Prior certification, and especially field activity as a NAUI Assistant Instructor, Skin Diving Instructor, or Divemaster is the best type of preliminary training you can get. By progressing up the certification ladder, continually refining your knowledge and ability as you learn from professional NAUI Instructors, you will learn about leadership.

### 5.12. <a name='Academics'></a>Academics

It is a NAUI tenet that we strive to know more than we teach. NAUI Instructors regularly help others develop an understanding of the practical applications and effects of various scientific principles related to recreational diving. Instructors must be able to effectively tutor in disciplines as diverse as the basic computational skills needed for dive planning to foster an understanding of basic cardiopulmonary function. All such instruction is aimed at the level needed to help divers and students make better diving decisions and minimize their potential risk while learning and diving.

It is therefore necessary to gain the skills necessary to teach in scuba-specialized areas of academics. Your ITC will help you develop teaching ability, but it is important that you be prepared in advance to make the most of the instruction you will receive.

## 6. <a name='PlanningandOrganizingDives'></a>Planning and Organizing Dives

### 6.1. <a name='Planning'></a>Planning

Every diver has heard the axiom:

> Plan your dive; dive your plan.

Its corollary for diving leadership is:

> If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.

Planning helps minimize the chance for errors by anticipating variables that might affect the event’s success. It includes deciding what needs to be done in every eventuality and how best to do it. Some of these are best accomplished well in advance, while others may be modified at the moment. They all affect one another and contribute to a dive’s success.

### 6.2. <a name='PrincipalStepsofPlanning'></a>Principal Steps of Planning

- Decide objectives.
- Recognize staff and student or diver needs.
- Identify equipment requirements.
- Schedule location, date, and time.
- Gather information.

#### 6.2.1. <a name='EstablishingObjectives'></a>Establishing Objectives

The first step in planning a supervised activity is to review the dive’s objectives, bearing in mind that the primary objective is always safe and enjoyable participation by all.

#### 6.2.2. <a name='OrganizingStaff'></a>Organizing Staff

Staffing first means identifying what roles must be filled to accomplish the dive’s objectives, and engaging people qualified to assist. Leaders must be able to judge the ability of their support personnel, motivate them and utilize them effectively. Staff must understand that they are expected to act professionally and are assuming responsibilities under the leader’s direction. The ultimate responsibility for the actions of diving staff rests with the leader in charge of the activity.

Certified assistant instructors, divemasters, skin diving instructors, or leadership trainees helping with instruction should realize that the responsibility for planning is the instructor’s, but their involvement can be mutually beneficial. They will learn a great deal from the instructor, and most NAUI Instructors will recognize that assisting staff can provide helpful reminders and suggestions.

#### 6.2.3. <a name='IdentifyingEquipmentRequirements'></a>Identifying Equipment Requirements

While all dives will require certain equipment in common, some activities require specialized gear. Acquiring and checking these items and ensuring that staff is familiar with their function and use are important parts of planning. Specialty training dives, technical dives, research dives, and night dives, for example, each require some unique equipment.

#### 6.2.4. <a name='SchedulingtheActivity'></a>Scheduling the Activity

Scheduling often identifies uncontrollable problems or timing conflicts. These may be minimized with forethought, but the best plan can fail due to natural or accidental circumstances. Variables such as weather, site conditions, engine breakdown, and the like can all have effects.

Whenever possible, an alternate dive site plan should exist in case the primary choice is somehow unsuitable. There will, however, be days when the only good choice is to postpone an activity. Leaders should have an alternate day scheduled, and divers should know if this possibility exists in advance. The contingency plans in these cases should include the possibility of refunds or future credit. Also consider that if the target dive location is a known to be unpredictable and alternative locations are not an option, it may be wiser to promote the excursion as a “great day at the beach” with scuba diving as a bonus – conditions permitting.

### 6.3. <a name='EvaluatingDivingConditions'></a>Evaluating Diving Conditions

Leaders need to learn about weather, water conditions, and temperature at chosen dive sites. The best way to obtain accurate information about a planned diving area is to combine research with an advance visit. Short of an extra visit, leaders should plan to arrive at sites well in advance of participants to “scout.” If you must escort the group, talk to other leaders and divers who have been to the site recently.

### 6.4. <a name='KnowingDiveParticipants'></a>Knowing Dive Participants

Learning as much as possible about the people with whom one will be diving is important to effective leadership. NAUI leaders who have participated in a scuba class, for instance, will have grown familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of students before scheduling training dives, and can plan more efficiently. They will also have the benefit of having established their credibility and competence in the minds of participants. Such familiarity can help reduce student anxiety. No open water training dives should be conducted unless leaders are certain that students have received sufficient training to participate with minimal risk.

Informal interviewing is an essential communication skill that makes planning and leading dives with unfamiliar people easier. Finding out about people’s prior dive experiences and training in a conversation is easy, but learning about how they feel about the current situation requires subtlety and time. NAUI leaders who frequently work with strangers should plan this time into their normal schedule. At a minimum, consider allowing enough time to review a person’s dive log or have a brief, one-on-one conversation before entering the water.

### 6.5. <a name='PlanningforEmergencies'></a>Planning for Emergencies

Gathering information on appropriate emergency equipment and qualified emergency aid providers is part of every NAUI member’s planning process. Leaders planning diving excursions to remote areas should inform participants in advance of the risk any lack of emergency treatment facilities may potentially create, so that they may make an informed decision on their participation.

Medical insurance and emergency contact information should be compiled from all participants. This can include a document granting permission to the NAUI member to initiate emergency treatment and activate local medical services in case a diver is unconscious.

NAUI leaders would also be wise to urge participants to acquire diving medical insurance that will cover the costs of evacuation, recompression therapy and other medical treatment, transportation home, and hospitalization.Gathering information on appropriate emergency equipment and qualified emergency aid providers is part of every NAUI member’s planning process.

### 6.6. <a name='OrganizingStaffandParticipants'></a>Organizing Staff and Participants

Diving leaders must always confirm that there are sufficient staff available to properly conduct a diving event. Staff must be involved, organized, and assigned various responsibilities before the start of any activity. Staff positions may include an Activity Leader, Activity Divemaster, Dive Team Leaders, and various assistants. Roles are frequently combined, depending on the location, activity, group size, and participants’ experience. Larger groups and training activities usually require proportionally more staff.

Participants should be made aware of staff members’ responsibilities and certification status. If uncertified trainees or non-leadership personnel are in staff positions, their roles especially should be clearly outlined to participants.

#### 6.6.1. <a name='ActivityLeader'></a>Activity Leader

The Activity Leader, usually an active-status instructor or divemaster, takes overall responsibility. The Activity Leader often initiates the activity through a class, or is put in charge by a store, club, or other diving services provider. To make the best use of available talent, an Activity Leader must recognize that different staff duties require different strengths. Concurrently, the Activity Leader must be ready to assume any staff role.

#### 6.6.2. <a name='ActivityDivemaster'></a>Activity Divemaster

The Activity Divemaster is responsible for maintaining the dive roster, taking roll, monitoring surface activities, advising participants, directing emergency response procedures, and working toward the efficient realization of the dive plan.

Activity Divemasters should be certified divemasters or instructors with the ability and experience to monitor all dive activities.

#### 6.6.3. <a name='DiveTeamLeader'></a>Dive Team Leader

Grouping divers into teams is an efficient method of organization for activities with a large number of participants, such as found in resort settings or aboard weekend dive charter vessels. A team will usually consist of more than one buddy group. A designated Dive Team Leader (DTL) who serves as the teams’ representative should direct each team. DTLs should be familiar with the dive site, the divers, and the diving activity.

There are many factors to be considered when assigning divers to teams: the planned activity, diver capabilities, equalization problems, physical ability, anxiety levels, and even domestic partner pairing. Every effort should be made to avoid forming dive teams with more than one marginal diver. Whenever possible, spread out less-capable divers among the teams so no one dive team has more than one diver who may require more than normal attention.

#### 6.6.4. <a name='QualifiedAssistants'></a>Qualified Assistants

When student numbers are too large in dive classes, qualified assistants may be used to create manageable dive teams or to bring student-instructor ratios within NAUI standards. A “qualified assistant” is an individual who has completed a designated NAUI course and registered with NAUI.

### 6.7. <a name='BuddyTeams'></a>Buddy Teams

NAUI supports buddy diving as a routine practice and aid to safer diving. It is practiced in all NAUI training activities. An Activity Leader will definitely face liability problems in case of any mishap that might be even remotely attributed to the lack of a buddy if the buddy system was not endorsed and used when conducting dive(s).

During recreational diving, Activity Leaders or Activity Divemasters encourage certified divers to select their own buddies. Though the two-person buddy team is most common, some diving specialty activities such as cave or wreck penetration may be best done in three-person teams. In training, NAUI Instructors must assign or approve students’ buddy choices.

### 6.8. <a name='MotivatingDivers'></a>Motivating Divers

Motivating divers usually involves helping them to behave in their own best interests. NAUI leaders are generally best able to motivate divers by a combination of “show and tell.” Remember that actions are based on attitudes that are based, in turn, on values: people ascribe worth to certain ideas and act accordingly. Remember, as well, that much behavior is learned by observing others and leaders are, by their position, highly visible. We can extrapolate from these ideas the two main motivational tools NAUI leaders can use:

1. Educating divers about our values and attitudes, fostering understanding and compliance through respect for knowledge;
1. Behaving in an exemplary professional manner that supports NAUI’s commitment to safe diving and environmental conservation.

### 6.9. <a name='RulesPoliciesandRegulations'></a>Rules, Policies, and Regulations

Establishing and communicating clear guideposts for appropriate conduct is an important part of planning successful diving activities and essential to effectively motivating divers. Such guides can be divided into three distinct categories, each of which can be of particular use to NAUI leaders.

#### 6.9.1. <a name='Rules'></a>Rules

Rules can be established by anyone, and violations are commonly understood to have consequences. They are especially useful for maintaining order, and reinforcing learned behavior if they are:

- Reasonable
- Explained
- Understood

Agreed to by those affected.

Instructors often use rules with constructive consequences to aid teaching and reinforce learning.

#### 6.9.2. <a name='Policies'></a>Policies

Policies are established procedures based on wisdom, knowledge, or good judgment, and are designed to facilitate or expedite some goal. They define the usual courses of action an individual or organization will follow or the conditions under which performance will occur. Policies should reflect prudence and appeal to reason and logic. Violations may generate social or personal disapproval, and/or violators may not be allowed to continue their participation until they conform to policies.

Leaders can exercise discretion in setting the rules and policies for their activities. In fact, the NAUI Standards and Policies Manual is an example of policies. NAUI leaders voluntarily agree to abide by them while conducting leadership activities in order to remain members in good standing and continue to receive the benefits of the Association.

#### 6.9.3. <a name='Regulations'></a>Regulations

Regulations are laws established by duly empowered authority. Compliance is not voluntary and punishments are prescribed for violations. Examples are U.S. Coast Guard regulations or city, provincial, state, and county laws, fish and game or environmental conservation laws or traffic codes. NAUI leaders are obligated to know and obey the laws that affect diving, should ensure that participants understand them, and should encourage compliance. NAUI members do not, however, enforce regulations; this job is reserved for authorized law enforcement personnel with legal jurisdiction.

NAUI leaders must insist upon lawful behavior and should not tolerate lawbreaking. Divers who break the law should be told they have and discouraged from continuing. If necessary, report offenders to the authorities.

### 6.10. <a name='Enforcement'></a>Enforcement

Like motivation, the primary enforcement methods available to NAUI leaders are effective education and their own behavior. By following rules and policies themselves and helping divers understand why such guides exist, NAUI leaders can gain cooperation. As with other potential diving problems, the best course of action to avoid enforcement issues is to anticipate and prevent them. Leaders are advised to make sure that divers understand requirements in advance, have the opportunity to discuss them, and thus make an informed choice about their participation.

One method of doing this is to have divers sign a “Statement of Understanding” when signing up to participate in any NAUI activity. A sample statement of understanding and enrollment agreement is available to be downloaded via NAUI’s website.

If a rule is violated, it is usually best to tell people immediately. Restate the management importance and tangible benefit of following the rule and request cooperation from that point on. Difficult though this may be, if the Activity Leader does not enforce rules and policies, they will soon become meaningless and of no value in controlling the group.

Always try to avoid confrontation or embarrassment. Keep discussion of infractions neutral, informative and focused on the objectionable action, not the person’s character or behavior. Tact, diplomacy, and humor will often defuse tension that can result from efforts to regulate behavior.

### 6.11. <a name='Preparation'></a>Preparation

Preparation includes preparing final briefings for staff and participants and otherwise ensuring that everything from gear to people is ready. Two excellent ways to prepare are with the use of checklists and by distributing fact sheets and printed instructions. Checklists are extremely useful memory aids for diving leaders, staff, or divers (samples for dive briefings and debriefings are contained in the NAUI Risk Management Handbook). Fact sheets help avoid misunderstanding and reduce repetitive questions.

Another excellent preparation technique is to get participants together at an advance meeting to set the ground rules for the activity. If people know what is expected of them beforehand, the activity will be much better organized, and it will be much more likely that everyone will arrive on time with everything they will need. The type of diving experience being organized will help determine what type of meeting and response to expect.

Leaders should organize their personal items and diving equipment, the dive support equipment, spare parts, extra gear, and emergency equipment well before any planned event. It is wise to use a checklist that inventories and indicates all necessary equipment has been inspected and tested. Replace parts or repair any items as needed and pack carefully. Encourage divers to take the same action with their own gear.

Additional preparation tasks include making a written briefing outline for the activity, preparing rosters, including possibly one on a waterproof slate, copying any required forms, compiling emergency contact information, and making final confirmation phone calls to ensure that the emergency telephone numbers you have are current and working.

One of the most important results of careful preparation is increased confidence for all. Participants with organized and complete information will be more confident in their ability to cope, and they will be much more confident in the ability of a thorough, organized leader. Relaxed, confident divers and leaders will enjoy the event more, and carefully planned, well prepared activities are much more likely to proceed without mishap than unprofessional, ad hoc affairs.

## 7. <a name='ConductingDivingActivities'></a>Conducting Diving Activities

### 7.1. <a name='Introduction-1'></a>Introduction

Whether in charge as a divemaster or instructor or assisting another leader, conducting safe, enjoyable dives is a basic goal and primary activity of NAUI members.

### 7.2. <a name='OverseeingDives'></a>Overseeing Dives

While it would be impossible to detail the specifics of every possible combination of divers and situations, there are some basic precepts that NAUI leaders can apply in overseeing most dives.

In the Glossary of the NAUI Standards and Policies Manual “Overseeing” is defined as:

> “The overall control, intermittent supervision, evaluation, and direction of instruction, student skill performance, and diving activities by a NAUI Instructor of a class or group of students. The instructor must be present at the training site prepared to direct and render appropriate in-water assistance in aid of a student.”

This in contrast to the definition of “Direct Supervision,” which is:

> “Supervision by the NAUI Instructor of the class or group of students from a distance allowing immediate intervention on behalf of the student. It is the level of supervision required while evaluating student performance of skills required for certification.”

These definitions help distinguish between supervising NAUI students during their initial scuba diver training experiences and subsequent experiences during which greater responsibility for dive conduct is transferred from instructors to students. Such transfer necessarily alters an instructor’s supervisory role from being able to immediately intervene to being present and ready to respond with aid to those in need.

### 7.3. <a name='Awareness'></a>Awareness

Accepting NAUI leadership responsibility means that one fully commits to responding to divers’ needs and helping ensure their safe enjoyment of diving. “Global Awareness,” the term used to describe the absolute concentration NAUI members use to support that commitment, is a combination of experience, judgment, and knowledge. More than simply watching, such awareness is based on continuously observing divers and dynamically assessing conditions, equipment, and the full range of other variables that contribute to a dive’s success.

### 7.4. <a name='EvaluatingConditions'></a>Evaluating Conditions

The overall criteria for evaluating any diving activity are the same for all diving groups and locales, but each diving event and its participants must be judged individually. NAUI members must decide whether the overwhelming majority of the divers present can most probably safely enjoy the dive, given the available personnel and conditions – not whether the site is “dive-able” for the leader or selected divers. It is especially important to judge to what extent the less skilled can be encouraged to participate.

Regardless of the activity or diving area, all factors that will affect divers should be noted. Such general water data as visibility, temperature, current, swell, or waves should all be evaluated. Dive platform considerations, such as an anchored boat’s swinging arc, shoreside terrain or beach, or freshwater diving, are still other factors. Considerations, however, vary by activity, and diving leaders must develop their critical judgment in order to make decisions about specific activities.

In practice, all activities benefit from a member of the dive staff getting into the water to assess actual conditions at the site. This is often accomplished when aiding a dive boat in anchoring or setting the dive flag and necessary floats for shore diving. Time for such direct observation should be included in the activity plan.

### 7.5. <a name='LeadershipCommunication'></a>Leadership Communication

Effective leadership of diving activities begins with the ability to communicate with divers above and below the water. Whether by distributing handouts of procedures or checklists in advance, making hand signals, writing on an underwater slate, or using a megaphone, horn, or whistle on the surface, leaders depend on their ability to transmit messages and instructions to divers.

In addition to standard underwater hand signals used by buddy teams, specialized leadership hand signals are useful for directing groups of divers. Some common ones are:

- Get with your buddy; where is your buddy?
- Follow me.
- Ascend a little.
- Inflate your BC.
- Deflate your BC.
- Get neutrally buoyant, level off.
- Exhale.
- Look (look close, look distant).
- Don’t touch or take.
- Relax, take it easy, slow down.
- Hold it. Wait here or wait there.
- Attention.
- Recall. Return to beach or boat.
- Aquatic life: fish, eelgrass, etc.
- Boat, ladder, or line.
- Check air supply, time, and depth.

Additional signals that might be useful at specific sites should also be included in briefings. These might include descriptive gestures for a particular feature of the dive, such as the deckhouse of a wreck, or the opening of a cavern, or the signals instructors use to request students perform various skills.

Some leaders make up a set of easily read underwater flashcards to avoid having to write frequently used messages repeatedly while diving. Having a set designed to communicate common instructions related to a specific activity, such as open water skill evaluations, can be very effective in keeping the activity well organized and ensuring completeness.

### 7.6. <a name='DiveBriefingsandDebriefings'></a>Dive Briefings and Debriefings

Briefings are the staple of directing all types of diving. They provide leaders their best opportunity to motivate good diving behavior, establish rapport with the group, and reiterate important safety information. Conducting a good dive briefing is an acquired artful skill that improves with practice.

Briefings usually take place at the dive site before participants don exposure suits and gear so that they are relaxed and comfortable. Avoid positions that place the sun or other strong light sources directly in front of the group, because that too will distract the group’s attention and make eye contact difficult.

Each briefing is like a mini-lesson review, and though they may often seem extemporaneous, careful leaders pay attention to the details they must include. Using a briefing outline with written notes. Rehearsing until thoroughly comfortable beforehand is highly recommended.

All briefings have elements in common. These are:

- Introductions: Self, any assistants, and professional medical personnel present.
- Area and environmental orientation: Facilities, restrictions, terrain, depths, water movement, aquatic life, hazards, navigational features, alternate exit point(s), and diving conditions.
- Activity schedule: General Schedule of activities, i.e., entry times, dive duration, depth limits, any planned events, maximum return time, time between dives, departure time, etc. Performance requirements for training dives.
- Instructions: Dive preparation, pre-dive checks, entry and exit techniques, diving activities/skills, ascent procedures, buddy system procedures, post-dive procedures, limits on gas supply, depth or time, touring procedures and precautions – safety, conservation, and preservation.
- Communications: Signals as needed, such as hand, recall, whistle, light, emergency, etc.
- Emergency procedures: Chain of command, location of emergency equipment, and access to emergency services.
- Questions and answers.

During training, debriefings with the entire class are part of each dive. While this will generally be conducted by the instructor, assistants may debrief individuals or groups with the instructor’s permission and oversight. The following information is appropriate for the debriefing of a training dive:

- Restatement of dive objectives.
- Discussion of achievement and overall performance.
- Recognition of good performance.
- Identification of general problems.
- Prevention/resolution of problems.
- Key points to remember.
- Questions and answers.
- Repetitive dive table calculations; logging of dive(s).

### 7.7. <a name='Pre-diveEquipmentInspections'></a>Pre-dive Equipment Inspections

Leaders customarily check divers’ equipment for completeness, placement, and basic serviceability, but the responsibility for ensuring that gear is adjusted, serviced, and functioning properly lies with the individual diver.

Divers should again be asked to inspect their own and their buddy’s equipment at the dive site after donning their gear. Remind divers to familiarize themselves with the placement and function of each other’s alternate air source, ballast system or weight belt release, and BC inflator. Prior to divers entering the water, the Activity Leader or Divemaster should also briefly check each diver for a few critical items, such as having a completely opened cylinder valve on a full cylinder, a functioning, connected BC inflator, a properly donned weight belt or ballast system and no loose or dangling gear. A quick visual inspection accompanied by a brief activation of the BC inflator or breath off of the regulator second stage, by the diver, while observing the pressure gauge, will alleviate concerns about cylinder fill status, regulator first-stage function, initial buoyancy, weight belt and other gear without unduly delaying diver entries.

### 7.8. <a name='OverseeingBoatDives'></a>Overseeing Boat Dives

Most recreational diving is done from boats. Boats allow divers to venture far beyond the reaches of local coves and beaches. Charter dive boats offering single- and multiple-day excursions are commonplace, and knowledgeable leaders are in demand to oversee diving operations for certified diver customers. These divers have a wide range of experience, skill, and ability, and leaders working in these settings must be fully prepared to deal with that range.

### 7.9. <a name='Pre-departureTasks'></a>Pre-departure Tasks

In addition to many of the common briefing elements listed previously, other tasks and topics to address prior to departure include:

- Boat orientation
- Boat rules and procedures
- Boat movement schedule: departure from dock, arrival at site, last dive entry, departure from site, arrival at dock.

### 7.10. <a name='Pre-departurePreparations'></a>Pre-departure Preparations

The diving leader aboard may be responsible for the appropriate stowage and security of all diving equipment. Diving leaders should also review the day’s plan, as well as alternate plans and emergency boating and diving procedures with the captain and crew.

### 7.11. <a name='EntryandExitProcedures'></a>Entry and Exit Procedures

Appropriate water entry and exit techniques should be covered in the pre-dive briefing. Suited buddy pairs, generally without fins on, make their way to the gate, do a final gear adjustment, put on their fins, and then are directed to make a stride or other entry. Upon returning, divers stabilize at the steps or ladder, and use the submerged rungs as anchor points from which to hand aboard gear to an assistant or divemaster.

### 7.12. <a name='LostGearRecovery'></a>Lost Gear Recovery

The following are recommendations for recovering lost gear. NAUI leaders should use their professional judgment to determine actual procedures to use at any dive site.

A NAUI leader’s first consideration when gear is lost is determining whether any search is feasible or warranted, given the risk it can entail. Gear recovery dives are dives. Leaders must ensure that any dives undertaken conform to recommended diving practices, including depth and time exposure limits and profiles. Also, recovery divers must have an adequate air supply. No equipment is worth any injury, and NAUI leaders are obligated to strenuously discourage any divers who would assume increased risks to attempt a recovery.

### 7.13. <a name='CheckingDiversInandOut'></a>Checking Divers In and Out

While there is nothing wrong with tight physical control at the entry gate, such an approach often creates a lengthening line of increasingly cranky, overheated divers waiting their chance to get into the water. Many experienced recreational divers argue that methodically checking divers into the water, which can include testing every diver’s gear, or recording their dive plans on a clipboard is intrusive, but the same process may comfort newer divers. With these extremes in mind, leaders should consider creative, less obtrusive options that maintain effective control without such drawbacks.

#### 7.13.1. <a name='CylinderCounts'></a>Cylinder Counts

Before the day of diving begins, all cylinders (crews’ included) are placed on the deck, counted, and the number recorded. When the boat prepares to move to a new site, cylinders are recounted to see if everyone is aboard.
Buddy Board
Each diver has a plastic tag with his or her name or an assigned number or letter on it. Immediately before entering the water each diver hangs the tag on a convenient “entry board” with pegs or hooks. Upon exiting the water the diver removes his or her tag.

#### 7.13.2. <a name='RollCall'></a>Roll Call

This is the most-used method to ensure divers are on board, but leaders are cautioned to advise all divers that they must answer for themselves.
Open-Gate Entry, Stern Check-In
This method works well when there is more than one diving leader aboard. After the pre-dive briefing, the dive gate(s) are open, and buddy teams enter the water when ready, while a staff member observes, ready to render assistance. Another staff member has the opportunity to walk the deck, observe and assist divers suiting up.

As divers return to the boat, a leader is positioned near the return ladder, who, while still watching those in the water, checks the boarding divers in, eliciting any other required information, such as depth and bottom time figures.

#### 7.13.3. <a name='ThePersonalTouch'></a>The Personal Touch

A variation of the above, this method challenges the leader to quickly learn each diver’s name, a skill that grows with practice. At the end of the dive when passengers climb aboard, the leader personally approaches each diver, greeting them by name and asking about their dive. Customers usually appreciate and respond to this personal approach, sometimes tipping generously at the end of a trip. In any event, this kind of rapport will make the leader’s job much easier.

#### 7.13.4. <a name='TheCattleChuteApproach'></a>The Cattle Chute Approach

This is the strictest method of entry control, but can cause real problems with efficiency, as previously noted. Physically checking each diver’s gear and air supply, and discussing the dive plan is probably only suitable when conducting initial training dives or when divers are obviously lacking experience and confidence.

### 7.14. <a name='DiverRetrieval'></a>Diver Retrieval

In spite of pre-dive instructions, some divers may surface far from the vessel. Raising an arm with a clenched fist, holding one brightly colored fin overhead, or surface marker buoy are commonly used in-water signals to request a pick-up, and such signals should be reviewed before the dive.

### 7.15. <a name='OpenWaterTrainingDivesfromBoats'></a>Open Water Training Dives from Boats

Non-certified divers require a greater degree of observation and control than experienced divers, and can only dive under the supervision of an active-status instructor or qualified assistants, albeit at reduced ratio. The only exception to this policy occurs in the NAUI Scuba Diver course for the navigation exercise on the second or subsequent training dives and only after evaluating the required skills.

### 7.16. <a name='Profiling'></a>Profiling

Dive schedules should be arranged so passengers make their deepest dives first. This time-tested practice can prevent excessively long required surface intervals between dives. NAUI’s RGBM dive tables, which have a stated surface interval of at least one hour, do not allow for reverse dive profiles. Overall it is simpler, safer, and wiser to dive progressively shallower profiles.

### 7.17. <a name='Post-diveActivities'></a>Post-dive Activities

As the boat moves from site to site throughout the day, leaders should tell passengers the travel time to the next dive site, what the site will be like, and approximately how deep it will be. This enables divers to relax, plan their next dive, possibly remove their exposure suits, and have something to eat and drink. Divers should refrain from consuming alcoholic beverages before diving. Groups should understand this policy prior to departure.

At day’s end, thank everyone for being aboard or joining the trip and remind them to check their belongings carefully to avoid leaving anything. Leaders should also check the boat thoroughly for lost gear before departing for the day.

### 7.18. <a name='OverseeingShoreDives'></a>Overseeing Shore Dives

Diving from shore offers a wide range of relatively inexpensive, easily accessible and rewarding diving opportunities. The shore-based diver is able to make dives at almost any time of the day or night. For the leader directing shore diving activities, planning, preparation, and organization are essential for a positive experience.

#### 7.18.1. <a name='SitePreparation'></a>Site Preparation

Initial site preparation includes assessing dive conditions, selecting and delineating entry and exit points, and setting the diving float and flag. At limited visibility locations, a guideline may be extended from shore along the bottom to offshore dive locations as part of site preparation.

These last preparation tasks provide an opportunity to assess conditions first-hand, and enable leaders to modify the planned activity, move to an alternate site, or even abort the dive, if warranted.

#### 7.18.2. <a name='Pre-Shore-DiveBriefings'></a>Pre-Shore-Dive Briefings

All the usual briefing considerations apply, and shore dives have some elements that need special attention. For instance, a shore dive briefing should emphasize the importance of being considerate of private property owners and beach users. There are restrictive ordinances for shore diving activities in many coastal areas of the United States because groups of divers have been noisy, left garbage on the beach, trespassed on private property, or parked illegally in residential areas. Leaders should encourage divers to be respectful of others living near or using the waterfront.

### 7.19. <a name='OverseeingSpecialtyDiving'></a>Overseeing Specialty Diving

Supervising specialty diving poses some special problems for NAUI leaders. Chief among these is that divers may participate in specialty activities without training or certification, despite strong recommendations to the contrary. Dives made to satisfy certification requirements in a specialty area should be treated like any other training dive.

### 7.20. <a name='NightDiving'></a>Night Diving

Night diving is probably the most common specialty activity that divers enjoy, and often without any additional training. Leaders should plan accordingly, organizing the event to accommodate the group’s general level of experience. This may require leaders to minimize the consequences of darkness. For instance, one can plan the dive to begin at dusk, ending after dark. Because the transition from daytime to full darkness will have only begun, divers will have time to slowly acclimate, and still experience the nocturnal underwater environment by the end of their dive. Dressing and entry activities will also be less stressful, benefiting from the more lighted conditions of dusk.

### 7.21. <a name='SiteSelection'></a>Site Selection

If possible, arrive at the night diving site before sunset and dive there in daylight as an orientation to the location and the diving conditions. Preferred sites are calm, protected anchorages or coves, or along shores with little water movement, such as surf or current, and unobstructed access. In any case, avoid areas with drop-offs, long swims, or difficult entries or exits. Night diving in areas with overhead environments can be particularly hazardous, as without cues from diminishing daylight, divers may be unaware they may no longer directly ascend to the surface.

### 7.22. <a name='SitePreparationAshore'></a>Site Preparation Ashore

An important aspect of shore-based night diving is adequate shore lighting and site management. Leaders should set up a well-lit area for suiting up and for pre-dive equipment inspections, generally using a variety of lanterns. Brightly lit beach parking lots make excellent staging areas, helping to avoid misplacing gear, as well as providing a reassuring atmosphere.

It is important to establish a welcome-home beacon on the beach. This is a range of two or three lights mounted above the high water line on shore. Used properly, such lights provide divers a quick reference for the exit point, and a means to avoid shallow and shore hazards when it is time to navigate back from the dive. Range lights should be positioned in a vertical line with the top light some distance behind the lower. Ideally, the lights will be of different colors as well, to aid in distinguishing them from one another and from street or house lights. Position these lights high enough so they can be seen from the water, but ensure that they will not confuse boaters seeking navigational aids.

If the lights are seen as one above the other, divers will know their exit point is straight ahead. If the lights are viewed in an oblique position, the divers will have to swim parallel to shore until the lights line up, then to shore.

### 7.23. <a name='NightDivingBoatPreparation'></a>Night Diving Boat Preparation

Consider all of the normal preparations for boat dives, and then do everything twice as carefully. It is important to ensure that divers can easily find the boat after completing the dive. The boat itself should be well lit, in addition to having navigational lights. Be particularly certain that the vessel is well anchored or moored, and that required light and flag signals are displayed. Floodlights, deck lights, lanterns, and cabin lights can all be used. An effective way to help divers navigate back to a boat during a night dive is to suspend an underwater strobe beneath the vessel, and to tie another such light to the anchor line. When visibility is good, a strobe can be seen from a considerable distance underwater. Whatever method is used to light the vessel and aid divers, leaders should make sure it is foolproof, and that a back-up system is available. Under most circumstances, someone knowledgeable should be left aboard to tend the vessel. Diving from unattended vessels offshore can be extremely hazardous, especially at night.

### 7.24. <a name='NightDivingEquipment'></a>Night Diving Equipment

Require each diver to have a small marker light or chemical light-stick (Cyalume®), plus a primary and a separate back-up dive light. Have spares for those who cannot meet these requirements. A sound signaling device, such as a whistle or BC-attached air horn with whistle backup, is highly recommended, as is an inflatable, brightly colored tube that may be illuminated above the water.

### 7.25. <a name='NightDivingBriefings'></a>Night Diving Briefings

Cover the risks involved with night diving carefully, and make sure each diver is making an informed choice to participate. Stress special night diving information in the briefing, such as:

- Recommend use of a descent line, which should be provided. Encourage navigating back to the line for ascents to help avoid disorientation. Stress buoyancy control, and reiterate the magnification effects of water.
- Review light signals and procedures, including when dive lights should be turned on and off and precautions for their use, such as exercising care to not blind buddies or surface personnel and being careful to avoid injury from dive lights tethered to wrists when entering and exiting the water. Remind divers that to be seen, hand signals must be made in front of a dive light.
- Encourage frequent monitoring of air pressure, depth, time, and direction, and recommend limited distance excursions during night dives to make finding the boat easier.

### 7.26. <a name='LimitedVisibilityDiving'></a>Limited Visibility Diving

Limited visibility is usually defined as horizontal visibility of 3 meters (10 feet) or less underwater. In some areas, sediment in the water near the surface diminishes the light to such an extent that dive lights are always necessary at depth. In such areas, the portion of the dive spent on the bottom is almost identical to a night dive, and those procedures should be used.

In other areas with sediment throughout the water column, a bright light may be useless because the sediment reflects much of the light back into a diver’s eyes as backscatter. In such conditions a, dimmer light can be more effective. Leaders should know the area and the most effective techniques for diving there. The key areas to emphasize for limited visibility dives are:

- Navigation: Divers must be oriented to enable them to find their entry/exit point.
- Buddy Contact: Proximity or even physical contact is in order to avoid separation while diving in limited visibility. If buddy lines are used, the divers should hold them, not be tied to them.
- Areas of high surge or possible entanglement should be avoided when visibility is limited.
- If water is turbid, and one is diving at night, maintaining contact with the bottom will help divers avoid vertigo and disorientation.

### 7.27. <a name='DivinginCurrents'></a>Diving in Currents

Dives from a fixed location, such as an anchored boat, are feasible with a mild current. However, inexperienced or less physically fit divers should be discouraged from entering the water if the current exceeds one-half knot. A current speed of about one knot will cause a drift rate of 30 meters (100 feet)/minute. This means that a diver in a one-half knot current will drift about 8 meters (25 feet) in about the time you took to read this paragraph.

Current speed can be derived measuring the time it takes a float attached to 30 meters (100 feet) of line to extend in the water from a fixed point. If it deploys in less than two minutes, the speed of the current is more than one half knot. Another method of estimating current is to measure the time it takes any floating object to travel from the bow to the stern of an anchored vessel of known length. If the boat is 8 meters (25 feet) long, and the object takes 15 seconds, the current is greater than one knot. In any case, if the current exceeds one knot or the ability level of the participants, consider drift diving.

Leaders should also remind divers to note the direction of the current at depth and on the surface, and begin their dives into any current so they may use it to their advantage at the end of the dive to return them to the entry/exit point. Divers should be told to not attempt fighting an overpowering current. If fatigued at depth, buddy teams should surface, establish buoyancy and signal to be picked up. Provisions for such pick-up should be part of the leader’s dive planning. If close to shore, they may swim across the current and exit down current at the shore, then walk back. Carrying signaling devices such as inflatable light tubes, personal strobes, whistles and horns is highly recommended.

### 7.28. <a name='DriftDives'></a>Drift Dives

Drift diving usually refers to either float or anchor drifts or liveboating, where free-swimming scuba divers are deployed and recovered from a moving vessel. All NAUI leaders should be familiar with drift diving procedures.

When currents are common, drift dives eliminate the need to work against the flow of water, and allow large areas to be explored relatively effortlessly.

#### 7.28.1. <a name='FloatDivingProcedures'></a>Float Diving Procedures

Float drifting is the preferred method for this popular activity. A boat follows a float that has a down line tied to it. The diving leader holds the bottom end of the float line, and the divers remain close to the line throughout the dive.

To end a float drift dive, the leader gives the signal to ascend and reels in the line to a suitable depth for a drifting precautionary decompression stop, usually around 5 meters (15 feet), which the group does together. Upon completion, the diving leader signals the divers to hold onto the line while unreeling enough line to accommodate the group, and all surface. Care should be taken to avoid unreeling too much line, increasing the risk of entanglement.
The boat approaches the group at the leader’s signal, stopping up current. As the boat drifts to the divers, a crew member on the boat throws a line to the leader in the water, who attaches the float line. The divers now have a current line to help them return to the dive boat.

#### 7.28.2. <a name='AnchorLineDriftDiving'></a>Anchor Line Drift Diving

This technique is good when there is a strong surface current (>1.5 knots), or when the boat’s windage will push the boat through otherwise still water. Anchor line drifts also work well when the water is rougher, making it difficult to see the float or surfacing divers. In theory, and frequently in practice, the drifting divers never lose contact with the boat. The disadvantage of using an anchor line is that it is more complicated and requires exceptional coordination between the boat operator, crew, and divers.

A long trail line should be deployed from the boat. Divers who fall off the drift line surface immediately and catch the trail line to return to the boat.

#### 7.28.3. <a name='RiverDiving'></a>River Diving

Correct techniques for diving in rivers may be learned from experienced professionals. Though similar to drift diving, river diving is a unique activity in its own right, and can be hazardous without specialized expertise. Assisting another NAUI leader experienced in this specialized area is an excellent way to acquire the skills, techniques, and knowledge necessary to lead river dives, while enjoying participation.

### 7.29. <a name='DeeperDives'></a>Deeper Dives

A deeper dive is a dive between the depths of 18-40 meters (60-130 feet). NAUI has training depth limits, but there are no depth restrictions on certified divers’ activities, only strong recommendations. Leaders should discourage divers from diving substantially deeper than they have been trained to dive, but generally have no authority to prevent certified individuals from diving as deeply as they choose. They may, however, refuse to participate in or lead such activities.

NAUI formed a technical diver training division in 1997 to codify the practice of diver training for planned decompression diving, use of mixed breathing gases and gas switches during dives, as well as dives that exceed 40 meters (130 feet).

The following procedures are appropriate for deeper dives, especially when the depth exceeds 24 meters (80 feet) and should be stressed in the leader’s briefing:

- Divers should be warned of the increased risks of deeper dives, including nitrogen narcosis, rapid depletion of the air supply, and decompression sickness.
- Leaders should remind divers that wetsuit compression at depth may cause a diver to become overweighted, and will contribute to more rapid chilling due to reduced insulation. It is especially critical to vent air from BCs and dry suits during ascent from deeper dives to avoid exceeding correct ascent rates.
- Leaders should encourage slow ascents, precautionary decompression stops, and careful air monitoring. Leaders should recommend that divers be equipped with redundant scuba systems, such as a pony bottle with separate regulator and pressure gauge, or appropriately equipped double cylinders. The deeper the dive, the greater the need for decompression lines and hanging extra air cylinders should depth and time limits be exceeded.
- Minimum instrumentation per diver should be a timer, depth gauge, submersible pressure gauge, and compass. Instruments, particularly dive computers, should not be shared by a buddy team.
- Divers lacking deeper diving experience and training should be encouraged to obtain such training before making deeper dives.
- Divers should clearly understand that they are responsible for their own decompression status and planning.
- Divers should be reminded to carefully review their own and their buddy’s dive plans.
- Buoyancy control is critical.
- All participants must be alert and prepared for DCS and out-of-air emergencies.

### 7.30. <a name='WreckDives'></a>Wreck Dives

Wrecks are popular dive sites, ranging from nearly indistinguishable debris on the bottom to dramatically imposing intact ships. Shallower, open wrecks are available in many areas and ships are being purposely scuttled to form artificial reefs and dive sites.

Penetration wreck diving requires special knowledge, equipment, and training. Wrecks may be intact or not, upside down, or strewn over a wide area. Many wreck dives involve deeper water, lower visibility, cold and currents, or dangerously situated or highly deteriorated vessels. Additional specialty or technical diver certification should be recommended to divers before they participate in any such dives.

### 7.31. <a name='WreckDivingProcedures'></a>Wreck Diving Procedures

Thorough knowledge of leadership procedures for boat, current, and deeper dives is needed for successful wreck diving. The following are general recommendations:

- The boat’s anchor line, mooring line, or some other means may be used to guide divers to and from the site, particularly in limited visibility. Divers should be reminded to use distinguishing features on the wreck to aid navigation. Compass navigation is inaccurate on metal wrecks.
- Taking of artifacts should be discouraged, and may even be illegal depending on the site.
- Divers should understand that penetration is recommended only for advanced and technical certified wreck or cave divers who are properly trained and equipped for that activity.

Night and low visibility dives on wrecks can be extremely hazardous. Such conditions can lead to accidental penetrations inside the wreckage. Avoid dive sites where this is a potential problem unless all participants are duly qualified.

### 7.32. <a name='Conclusion'></a>Conclusion

All specialty, technical, and “out of the ordinary” dives require specialized leadership techniques, training, and extra planning. Leaders organizing specialty dives are advised to include other qualified NAUI leaders as staff.

## 8. <a name='GuidingandEscorting'></a>Guiding and Escorting

## 9. <a name='Introduction-1'></a>Introduction

Guiding certified divers is often the basis for a divemaster’s or scuba instructor’s employment. The NAUI active-status member assumes responsibility for leading divers underwater, showing them to and around a particular site, and guiding them back to the boat or shore exit point.

NAUI Divemasters, Assistant Instructors, Training Assistants and scuba-certified Skin Diving Instructors working under the supervision of an active-status NAUI Instructor may escort divers-in-training on the surface and may also accompany up to two students underwater after the skills evaluation portions of the second and subsequent open water training dives.

### 9.1. <a name='GuidingCertifiedDivers'></a>Guiding Certified Divers

Successful dive guides are able to lead a group underwater, helping to improve divers’ skills by example and advice, and preventing and dealing with problems. Though certified divers are qualified to dive without leadership help or supervision, they frequently make arrangements to be guided underwater for many reasons. Divers may wisely request guiding services because a site is hard to find or new to them. Diving resort owners employ guides to make their diving operations more efficient, and to enhance guests’ enjoyment. Besides leading groups underwater, guides may assist divers into and out of the water and, depending on the circumstances, fulfill other Activity Leader or Divemaster duties as well.

Given the range of diving variables, not the least of which is the divers themselves, dive guides cannot assume the role of personal safety guardian or lifeguard. Guides should emphasize these facts to their groups, and point out that although their assistance is available, a diver’s buddy will almost invariably be closer, and thus better able to give aid than the leader.

Divers often ask guides to help them participate in personal interests, such as taking game, photography, video, or finding artifacts. Guides should avoid participation in such activities to the extent they may distract them from their primary responsibility to the group.

### 9.2. <a name='GroupOrganization'></a>Group Organization

There is no maximum number of certified divers a NAUI leader may guide underwater. Depending on the activity and divers, however, eight to ten is a reasonable number for one experienced guide under ideal daylight conditions in clear, calm water.

### 9.3. <a name='BuddyDiving'></a>Buddy Diving

Despite contrary minority opinions, buddy diving is the industry’s standard practice, and is unmitigated by the presence of a dive guide or participation as a member of a larger group. Whenever necessary, guides should facilitate buddy pairs’ forming, making introductions and suggestions. However, assigning people to one another is not part of the guide or divemaster’s role; nor are such pairings within their power to enforce.

If aware of their increased risks and willing to accept them, especially in writing, divers should be permitted to dive in non-standard teams of threes or more. The same concept must apply to those who desire to dive alone. Such unpleasant situations are greatly helped, and often avoided, if participants are aware of the rules and policies before they commit to the activity.

### 9.4. <a name='EntryProcedures'></a>Entry Procedures

Divers should be checked on entry as usual. If an Activity Divemaster is directing from the surface, the guiding leader can enter the water before the group. If no other leadership personnel are present, it is generally better for guides to assist divers while they make their entries and enter last.

If a floating line is used to assemble the group, the leader should be certain that there is enough room for all the divers on the line. If surface conditions are unsuitable for assembling the group, divers may be instructed to descend in buddy pairs to some convenient point on the line or to assemble in buddy pairs as a group on the bottom.

### 9.5. <a name='DescentProcedures'></a>Descent Procedures

Guiding divers during descent is one of the most difficult aspects of any dive. Currents, poor visibility, apprehension, equipment malfunction or misuse, and equalization difficulties can all pose problems that must be resolved; even though they are generally beyond a guide’s direct control. Except for calm, still, shallow water dives, it is best to have the group descend on a line and to keep the line within sight until all divers and the guide are on the bottom. This practice at least keeps everyone together at the beginning, and it allows the guide the best chance to assist any divers who may experience difficulty, without losing contact with the rest of the group.

It should be explained, understood, and agreed during the briefing that anyone who cannot descend within two minutes after the start of the descent will abort the dive and wait for the next one. Individuals who are unable to equalize underwater should be escorted to the exit point.

### 9.6. <a name='AscentandExitProcedures'></a>Ascent and Exit Procedures

Ascent and exit techniques and precautions should be explained before the dive. Guided divers should be requested to ascend on a line, whenever possible, reminded about ascent rates and practices, and reminded about performing a precautionary stop of at least three minutes at 5 meters (15 feet) at the end of all dives. Since guided divers are certified, buddy teams may ascend independently of the group. Guides should also ask divers to notify them before leaving the group, particularly if a buddy pair is ending the dive.

Guides should stay with the majority of the divers, and generally exit the water last. If there are no leadership or other support personnel at the surface, then the group should gather at the original assembly float or line and await the guide’s instructions. Depending on circumstances, the guide may leave the water first to assist the others out or stay in the water to assist any divers waiting to exit.

### 9.7. <a name='PositioningProcedures'></a>Positioning Procedures

The most important groundwork for successful guiding underwater is positioning. Guides must position themselves in relation to the terrain and must position divers for maximum visibility and control.

### 9.8. <a name='BriefingConsiderations'></a>Briefing Considerations

A dive guide’s briefing should include all the usual information and should stress that individual divers retain responsibility for their own and their buddy’s safety, although diving as part of a larger guided group. Other specific points to include for guided dive briefings are:

- A description of the type of positioning to be used during the dive, and the request that divers maintain the same relative positions throughout the dive.
- The suggestion to divers that it is their responsibility to keep track of the guide, not vice-versa.

### 9.9. <a name='Communications'></a>Communications

Guides, like other diving leaders, need better communications than those afforded by only standard hand signals. Guides often develop unique signals that pertain only to frequently dived specific sites. Special hand signals can be used and should be reviewed during the dive briefing.

Simple audible communications can be effective when divers are told in advance to be specifically alert for them. There are various underwater communications devices commercially available, but none are as inexpensive and routinely effective as hand signals or writing on a slate.

Divers should understand what to do when the recall is sounded, such as return to the boat and surface, or surface directly and look to the boat for instructions. Standard light signals should be reviewed before guided night dives.

### 9.10. <a name='HandlingUnderwaterDifficulties'></a>Handling Underwater Difficulties

Guides will eventually face every imaginable problem. No matter how unlikely or impossible it may seem for an event to occur, it will sooner or later happen, and generally at the worst possible time. It is important to understand that it is not a question of “if,” but of “when.”

### 9.11. <a name='Separation'></a>Separation

It is important for the divers to understand they have the responsibility of maintaining contact with their guide. Pre-dive agreement on a general dive pattern and diver positioning can help, but procedures for reuniting if separation does occur should be discussed and agreed upon before the dive. Guided individuals who become separated from the group should follow the procedures established in the pre-dive briefing.

Guides generally should not ascend to look for separated divers or bring the entire group to the surface to do so. Guides fulfill their obligation by doing their best to keep track of everyone and informing divers of their responsibility.

### 9.12. <a name='EquipmentProblems'></a>Equipment Problems

Guides face the same risks as other leaders in lending divers equipment, or hastily “repairing” gear. If the equipment is faulty, it can result in an accident, which may be attributed to the leader despite their helpful motivation. Divers with such problems should be discouraged from diving until the equipment is repaired or replaced. Though such actions can be complicated when the guide represents the entity from which the gear may have been rented or purchased, having appropriate spares available, and ensuring all gear is working properly before leaving for the dive, will prevent or resolve such problems.

### 9.13. <a name='ExceedingMaximumPlannedDepth'></a>Exceeding Maximum Planned Depth

The choice to chase a diver who descends deeper than the planned maximum depth is a difficult one for any diving leader, but guides have a responsibility to the whole group that supersedes jeopardizing themselves in this manner. The issue is complicated when a buddy team or large fraction of the group is significantly deeper than planned. Positioning problem aside, guides should attempt to gain the attention of the offending diver(s) with audible signals, hand signals, or by dropping a small object in front of the diver(s), if possible. The diver(s) should then be signaled to ascend to the agreed depth and signaled to check air supply and decompression status as applicable.

Guides working in areas with extreme drop-offs should particularly stress the divers’ responsibility to accurately monitor depth. Leaders should also advise divers to have contingency depth plans available so they may properly shorten their dives if the original planned depth is exceeded. Though dive computers automatically keep track of depth, time, and no-decompression limits, divers should be aware that the information can change rapidly as depth increases, and they should monitor such devices carefully throughout the dive, especially in reference to remaining air supply and safe ascent procedures.

### 9.14. <a name='AirConsumptionProblems'></a>Air Consumption Problems

It is generally unacceptable to terminate a dive for an entire group of certified divers when a diver or buddy pair is low on air and everyone else in the group has sufficient air to comfortably continue.

If one member of a dive team is low on air and the anchor line or exit point is distant, that buddy team should be directed to the surface. They may then return to the exit point, while the remainder of the divers complete the dive. This contingency should be discussed as part of the dive briefing, and divers should be aware of the procedure to follow.

One of a guide’s primary concerns is that a diver will run out of air. It is every diver’s responsibility to prevent this from occurring, and guides should encourage divers to plan to prevent and deal with this possibility. For instance, each dive team should be reminded to review air sharing procedures before diving together.

In the event a buddy cannot or does not share air with an out-of-air diver, guides should, if possible. Guides should similarly always try to prevent an out-of-air diver, or one who rejects the regulator, from bolting to the surface if possible. Divers who make emergency ascents should be accompanied until out of the water.

Circumstances can necessitate returning the whole group to the surface, depending on the location, activity, and divers remaining. Guides should plan the most appropriate procedure for their activities, bearing in mind their responsibility to the group and the needs of the distressed diver. Helping distressed, possibly injured, or apparently disabled divers is part of a guide’s leadership responsibility, but actions must be weighed against imperiling the other divers in the group.

### 9.15. <a name='InjuriesandAccidents'></a>Injuries and Accidents

While guides are not lifeguards, and distressed divers should first obtain assistance from their buddies, NAUI members are trained professionals and routinely expected to help divers underwater and at the surface as best they can. Once the decision to aid or rescue is made, the diving leader must perform to the standard of care of a diving professional, and must see the emergency through to completion. Normally, this means until the point when victims can be turned over to more qualified emergency care providers.

### 9.16. <a name='EscortingStudentDivers'></a>Escorting Student Divers

The major difference between guiding certified divers and escorting students is the increased level of responsibility, care, and vigilance required when working with relatively inexperienced students in open water. All escorts are subject to the explicit directions of the NAUI instructor in charge of the training activity.

### 9.17. <a name='EscortingontheSurface'></a>Escorting on the Surface

Leaders assigned to escort students must be certain that they understand exactly what is expected of them. The procedures they will follow should then be discussed with the students they will escort, reviewing directions to ensure their own and students’ common understanding of the instructor’s plan.

In addition to any specific directions the instructor provides, escorts should ensure that student divers:

- Enter the water with enough air in their BC to be buoyant (except in specialized surf entries where it may be necessary for the divers to swim under the surf zone on regulator, surfacing outside it);
- Use their snorkels unless otherwise instructed;
- Remain in a compact group, and within touching distance of their buddies;
- Follow their escort;
- Consistently observe and listen to the escort for signals or instructions.

Escorts should stay close to, and particularly concentrate their attention on the students during entries and exits. Students are unfamiliar with their new center of gravity with gear on, and may need assistance to keep from falling. After entry, students may experience disorientation or adjustment problems for which an escort should be alert.

Once in the water and moving toward the destination, escorts usually swim on their backs, enabling them to continually monitor and encourage following students.
Students should generally swim face down at the surface, looking frequently at their buddy and their escort, with either a snorkel or their regulator second stage in their mouths.

Escorts should strive to make surface excursions informative and enjoyable. Stopping from time to time is a good idea that enables student divers to regroup and rest.

Escorts should never leave students for whom they are responsible unless specifically relieved by the instructor or replaced by another qualified escort. Students should never be left alone at the surface or taken underwater without the supervising instructor’s explicit direction.

### 9.18. <a name='EscortingUnderwater'></a>Escorting Underwater

Remember at all times that escorts are not diving with students, rather they are assisting instructors with completing students’ open water training. Escorts position themselves much closer to students than a guide does to a group of certified divers or most buddies ever do to one another. Escorts are nearly always within touching distance of student divers, especially before the students have completed their third training dive.

An escort must fully understand and accurately follow the supervising instructor’s directions regarding any underwater tour conducted. Escorts should know and review with students the tour’s depth, time, and distance limits, and the desired procedures to follow after the tour’s completion.

An escort may accompany a buddy pair by remaining slightly above and behind, either to the left or the right, but within touching distance. If assigned a single student, escorts maintain a position that easily enables them to render any necessary aid to the student and reinforce the concepts of buddy diving.

When the instructor turns the students over to an escort underwater, such as after conducting skill evaluations, the escort should immediately take charge.

Escorts must adjust their swimming pace to accommodate students’ abilities and should encourage students to move slowly and gracefully through the water by doing so themselves. Escorts provide students with a sharp visual example, and using standard “demonstration quality” underwater techniques is mandatory. Escorts should avoid uncommon maneuvers, however impressive, when working with students. Remind students about buoyancy adjustments and buddy contact, and use routine hand signals to have them check and communicate their cylinder pressure to each other, and their escort, frequently. Escorts should look at students’ gauges on occasion, in addition to accepting their hand signals, to ensure accuracy.

Students who are to ascend with their escorts should be instructed prior to the dive to remain at exactly the same level and maintain the same ascent rate as their escort throughout the exercise. NAUI leaders should scrupulously observe the ascent procedures the students have been taught and discuss these with the supervising instructor to ensure compliance. If possible, escorts should make a precautionary decompression stop at a depth of 5 meters (15 feet), even though a stop may not normally be required from the training depth. Such a stop helps ensure a well-controlled ascent and helps students develop prudent diving habits.

### 9.19. <a name='Post-diveActivities-1'></a>Post-dive Activities

The instructor will most likely conduct a formal debriefing of the training experience for the entire group. Prior to this most instructors take a moment privately with their staff after all students have exited the water to gain escorts’ insights about individual student’s problems. Escorts should be prepared to provide instructors with feedback relative to student performance on the tour at this point.

## 10. <a name='ProblemManagementandCounseling'></a>Problem Management and Counseling

### 10.1. <a name='PhasesofProblemManagement'></a>Phases of Problem Management

Diving problems will inevitably arise despite the best planning and preparation. Whether solved by counseling or more direct means, leadership thinking always precedes leadership action in successful problem resolution.

The three general phases of problem management are anticipation, recognition, and management.

#### 10.1.1. <a name='Anticipation'></a>Anticipation

For diving leaders, anticipation means expecting the unexpected and being prepared to deal with it. NAUI leaders anticipate problems by using their training, experience, and awareness to evaluate the dive site and environmental conditions, examine participants’ equipment and, especially, observe divers’ behavior during the pre-dive phase.

Leaders can create opportunities to judge divers’ readiness and emotional state by initiating friendly, individual pre-dive conversations.

Though a diver’s mannerisms and conduct are useful indicators of internal states, leaders should especially observe divers’ eyes. Eyes will almost always reveal whether a person is suffering excessive pre-dive stress.

#### 10.1.2. <a name='Recognition'></a>Recognition

Most diving problems fall into one or a combination of the following categories:

- Physical
- Psychological
- Environmental
- Skill related
- Equipment related
- Physical problems include fatigue, head colds, motion sickness, or muscle cramps.
- Psychological problems stemming from strong positive or negative emotions can affect any diver’s behavior. Beginning divers are especially prone to anxiety and apprehension.
- The environment is the least controllable variable once committed to a dive; hence, careful judgment must be exercised prior to that point–and remain active throughout the dive. Poor visibility, currents, cold water, rough sea conditions, extreme surface conditions such as heat, cold, wind or precipitation, and marine life, can unnerve divers and undo all the preparation that preceded the dive.
- Poor diver skills due to inexperience, inadequate training, infrequent practice or misplaced concentration often cause problems. Ill-prepared divers’ reactions to even moderately challenging conditions or minor equipment difficulties can be ineffective and cause inordinate stress.
- Equipment problems can be extremely serious when diving. A low air supply, leaking mask, or a hard breathing or free-flowing regulator might completely disable a diver. A wetsuit that is too tight, seriously restricting breathing, or one that is too loose, allowing cold water to enter, can cause physical and psychological problems.

#### 10.1.3. <a name='Management'></a>Management

Successful management of any diving problem requires three definite leadership actions:

1. Assess the Situation

The primary actions of assessment include to determine if the situation poses an immediate danger and to determine what, if anything, the leader can reasonably do to help resolve the difficulty.

2. Respond Appropriately

Although leaders may see the same problems frequently, each incident is unique, since a different diver experiences it.

3. Resolve a Problem, if Possible

The more people do for themselves, the more they preserve self-esteem and learn to deal with or avoid problems. Lead divers to think of answers for themselves. When problems are handled this way, the solutions will have greater clarity than if they were merely proposed by the leader. Whenever possible, try to have the diver and buddy deal with a problem rather than solving it for them.

If assistance is necessary, give only that required to resolve the difficulty. The best in-water assists are quiet and inconspicuous. Leaders should deal with problems in a matter-of-fact manner. Never minimize the diver’s problem, only the response.
Physical, psychological or skill-related problems often produce unsafe levels of stress. Pre-dive, these problems require counseling, and possibly advice against a diver’s participation. In the water, a return to the boat or shore may be the best solution. Post-dive counseling and reassessment of the diver’s stress level will be necessary before another dive is attempted.

Equipment problems underwater should be judged on difficulty and the stress they cause the diver. Some underwater problems, such as a leaky mask seal caused by a folded skirt or trapped hood, can often be easily resolved by an observant leader or buddy, and the dive can continue. Discourage anyone with faulty gear from diving, and strongly advise divers against disabling or disconnecting malfunctioning equipment, such as an inflator that leaks air into the BC and then continuing a dive.
At best, divers can only hope for a draw in a battle with the environment. Serious environmental problems usually mandate postponing diving until conditions become acceptable. Do not lead divers under conditions regarded as unsafe, such as when there is excessive current, high surf, surge, rough water, zero visibility, or those that may become so, despite the divers’ eagerness.

### 10.2. <a name='TypicalDivingProblemsandSolutions'></a>Typical Diving Problems and Solutions

Problem solving is the action undertaken to overcome obstacles or correct an undesirable situation and achieve a NAUI leader’s primary goal–to optimize safety and enjoyment for all divers. Solutions for specific problems in the field will come from the applied synthesis of a NAUI leader’s training, ability, and experience. However some problems seem to occur so frequently and so similarly that it is possible to offer typical solutions.

### 10.3. <a name='PhysicalProblems'></a>Physical Problems

#### 10.3.1. <a name='Overexertion'></a>Overexertion

Make contact and get the diver to stop all activity. If the person is at the surface, establish buoyancy. Tell the diver to relax, breathe slowly and deeply, and exhale completely. Observe carefully to make sure these are being done. Keep contact and coach them until they are fully relaxed and breathing normally. Carefully reassess their ability to continue the dive. Assist the person from the water if the conditions remain strenuous or their difficulty is not completely resolved.

#### 10.3.2. <a name='DiverUndertheInfluenceofDrugsorAlcohol'></a>Diver Under the Influence of Drugs or Alcohol

Ask the diver to refrain from diving. Counsel the individual privately regarding the dangers of diving under the influence. Refuse to lead any group under water that includes this person.

#### 10.3.3. <a name='DiverBecomesIllDuringaDive'></a>Diver Becomes Ill During a Dive

Illness can be a serious, immediate danger, especially if it occurs underwater. The ill diver should be assisted to the surface and back to the shore or boat. Advise the diver not to dive until the illness and its symptoms have been resolved. If the diver has been diving previously, be especially alert for any symptoms that could be diving related. If a diving-related illness is suspected, take immediate appropriate action.

#### 10.3.4. <a name='DiverUnabletoEqualizeDuringDescent'></a>Diver Unable to Equalize During Descent

This can frequently be avoided by reminding divers to control their buoyancy and descend as slowly as they need to allow for frequent and easy equalization. Remind them also that if a squeeze develops during descent, they should stop, ascend slowly and slightly while breathing normally until any pain or discomfort is completely relieved and pressure equalizes. When comfortable, the diver may slowly re-descend trying various equalization techniques. A diver should be assisted from the water if equalization is not possible after repeated attempts.

#### 10.3.5. <a name='Pre-DiveOverheating'></a>Pre-Dive Overheating

Know the symptoms and recognize the signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Have divers with early symptoms get wet to cool down, remove their exposure suits or leave the hot environment. Affected divers should rest and drink abundant water, even if not thirsty. Do not allow them to dive until the situation is resolved completely.

#### 10.3.6. <a name='ChillingandHypothermia'></a>Chilling and Hypothermia

Know the symptoms and be alert for signs of hypothermia at the surface, underwater, and especially between repetitive dives. Hypothermic divers underwater may lose the effective use of their hands, arms, and legs, make irrational decisions, or in severe cases, become unconscious, posing a severe hazard to themselves and their buddies.

Have chilled divers remove all wet apparel and rewarm by donning dry clothes and drinking warm liquids, especially water. Discourage any cold divers from re-entering the water until completely rewarmed, which can take many hours. Seriously chilled individuals should discontinue further diving for the day.

There is a significant difference between comfort, skin temperature, and core temperature. An apparently warm individual may still be internally cooled, and thus susceptible to more rapid and dangerous chilling on a subsequent dive. Leaders should try to determine why divers became cold, such as from too much exposure, improper thermal protection, or both, when assessing whether they should dive again that day.

#### 10.3.7. <a name='RapidBreathing'></a>Rapid Breathing

Hyperpnea (speed breathing) has serious physiological effects and must be avoided. Attempt to calm excited or anxious divers. If divers at the surface are unable to control respiration, assist or have them assisted from the water. If divers are underwater, make contact and signal them to control respiration, then escort them to the surface, if necessary. Divers should later be counseled on correct breathing and to determine specific reasons for the occurrence.

#### 10.3.8. <a name='LegandOtherMuscleCramps'></a>Leg and Other Muscle Cramps

Direct the diver to extend the cramped muscle, such as by pulling back on the fin tip in the case of cramps in the calf or hamstring, straightening the leg, or other actions as appropriate. Divers should be advised to use a different kick to prevent recurrence of leg cramps if they are apparently due to insufficient conditioning. A cramped muscle can sometimes be relieved by massage, direct external pressure, or relieving tight constraints, such as in the case of foot cramps resulting from overly tight heel straps or fin foot pockets. If cramps recur, the diver should be assisted from the water.

#### 10.3.9. <a name='MenstrualCramps'></a>Menstrual Cramps

Menstrual cramp discomfort severe enough to distract a diver will likely also prevent the desire to dive. However, divers who have taken medication to relieve menstrual pain should be advised of the risks before they decide to participate.

#### 10.3.10. <a name='Injuries'></a>Injuries

Minor injuries (scrapes or scratches) may be dealt with following the dive. More serious injuries (ruptured eardrum, serious cuts, wounds from aquatic life, suspected lung over-pressure) call for the dive team to exit the water for the administration of first aid and possible evacuation. Leaders should be in close proximity or have physical contact with the injured diver during the exit. Be aware that some divers may have a serious allergic reaction to sea life stings, possibly leading to life-threatening shock and asphyxiation. Counsel and screen for this if it is a hazard of the area.

#### 10.3.11. <a name='Entanglement'></a>Entanglement

Have the entangled diver stop all movement and regain calm. Carefully detach the entanglement, making sure not to inadvertently remove any of the diver’s equipment.

### 10.4. <a name='PsychologicalProblems'></a>Psychological Problems

NAUI leaders should understand that their responsibility to foster safer and more enjoyable recreational diving includes always respecting a diver’s fear, and supporting any participant’s decision not to dive. Fearful, anxious, or reluctant people should never be persuaded to enter the water.

#### 10.4.1. <a name='ExpressedFearofDepthWaterConditionsEtc.'></a>Expressed Fear of Depth, Water Conditions, Etc.

Calm the diver and offer reassurance. Perform an extensive equipment check and site orientation. Leaders should also give a more detailed briefing, explaining the relative safety of the particular area and, if deemed appropriate, ways to deal with possible difficulties related to the particular aspects of the dive causing concern. Leaders should counsel fearful divers to determine whether it is advisable for them to participate.

#### 10.4.2. <a name='PeerPressure'></a>Peer Pressure

This is one of the strongest stress-creating factors a diver can encounter. Friends pressure friends. Couples or spouses push each other. The negative influence is often unintentional, or may be related to issues apart from diving. In any case, the result is always the same and real: undue stress. The proper handling of this situation often centers on dealing with the diver creating the stress, not with the upset diver.

#### 10.4.3. <a name='TimePressure'></a>Time Pressure

All divers’ performance, and students’ in particular, can be adversely affected by stress caused by time deadlines. Divers may feel rushed to get ready and into their equipment to meet the dive boat’s gate time or the leader’s stated starting time, or they may rush to catch the proper tide or current in an estuary or coastal dive, or to complete some diving activity before dark. Underwater, inert gas uptake provides time stress in completing dive objectives within table limits, and the limited amount of breathing gas within any cylinder, especially on deeper dives, can prove exceedingly stressful to some. Much of this stress can be prevented by having divers prepare early, carefully plan their dives.

#### 10.4.4. <a name='TaskLoading'></a>Task Loading

Trying to handle many new variables at once can lead to undue stress. Divers in an unfamiliar environment, using new or different equipment, or participating in new diving activities can have too many fresh items and skills to remember. For example, underwater hunting, photography, and other specialty areas can all subject divers to task loading because of the extra equipment they must carry. Even just carrying a dive light and a spare on a night dive can stress some divers.

#### 10.4.5. <a name='GeneralAnxiety'></a>General Anxiety

Have the person helped from the water if the level of anxiety cannot be brought under control. Anxious individuals should not dive until totally calm and completely in control. This frequently requires that the affected person leave the water and wait for a later dive.

#### 10.4.6. <a name='PanickedDiver'></a>Panicked Diver

A panicked diver requires immediate aid from a diving leader. Panic can be the end result of any diving problem, and can occur even if the antecedent problem was apparently resolved. While every situation is unique and there is no set procedure for handling every incident, there are general rules NAUI leaders can follow if a diver does panic.

If the person is at the surface, take immediate steps to create buoyancy. Closely evaluate the situation before establishing contact with a panicky diver, who will likely grab and attempt to climb on top of you. (Leaders who must get within reach should have their regulator firmly in their mouths.) If on scuba it may be best to make an underwater approach and release the diver’s ballast.

If panic occurs underwater, realize that the diver may attempt rapid flight to the surface. Make physical contact with and attempt to calm the diver to prevent them from bolting to the surface, if possible. If such flight occurs, try to control the ascent without incurring undue hazard. If the diver cannot be controlled, make a controlled ascent in as close proximity as possible in order to aid the diver on the surface. On reaching the surface, establish buoyancy and assess for injury. Help the diver back to the boat or shore, and continue to monitor the individual carefully for signs of diving maladies. Immediately treat the diver if they complain of any symptoms or signs of injury are observed. Leaders should urge any divers who make an uncontrolled or emergency ascent to seek a diving-specific medical evaluation at their first opportunity.

### 10.5. <a name='EquipmentProblems-1'></a>Equipment Problems

NAUI leaders should advise a diver with inappropriate or malfunctioning equipment not to enter the water unless the problem is resolved.

Leaders conducting pre-dive equipment checks must alert divers to non-standard types of equipment or gear placement, such as dive tools located on the outside of the leg, improperly deployed weight belts, etc., as well as improperly assembled gear. Remember however, that some equipment configurations that may be viewed as “standard” are only customary. All divers should be reminded to familiarize themselves with their buddy’s gear, especially the function of releases, and the location and operation of any alternate air sources. Buddies should discuss and agree upon an air-sharing technique prior to diving as part of their dive planning.

Some common malfunctions such as a loose weight belt or accidental release of the scuba cylinder-retaining device can be easily fixed at depth, preferably on the bottom. Other problems may occur at the surface, such as a free-flowing second stage that erupts on entry. Any regulator that does not respond by simply turning the second stage mouthpiece-down or to two or three sharp raps on the palm of the hand should not be used until properly adjusted by a qualified technician. If free-flow occurs underwater, the regulator may again respond by being turned mouthpiece down and/or by having the purge button momentarily depressed to dislodge debris that has lodged between the valve lever and housing. Leaders attempting to aid a diver in these circumstances are cautioned to ensure that the affected diver is not breath-holding during the repair and is continuously exhaling and producing a small stream of bubbles. If the difficulty is not resolved, the affected diver and buddy should make a controlled ascent to the surface. A student diver with this problem must be accompanied to the surface by the supervising instructor or a qualified escort, depending on the circumstances.

#### 10.5.1. <a name='MissingItems'></a>Missing Items

Ask the diver to postpone diving if a required item of equipment is not available, not functional, or inappropriate.

#### 10.5.2. <a name='UnfamiliarEquipment'></a>Unfamiliar Equipment

Divers should be discouraged from diving with primary equipment with which they are unfamiliar. This can often be the case when even an experienced diver has upgraded to new gear, some new feature has been added or a modification made to older gear. Leaders should be alert for such potential problems when examining an individual’s gear and observing divers assemble their scuba units.

#### 10.5.3. <a name='InadequateEquipment'></a>Inadequate Equipment

Just as with unfamiliar equipment, divers should be discouraged from diving with equipment that does not comply with prudent diving practices and recommendations, such as having inappropriate instrumentation that does not include at least a submersible pressure gauge and a means to know one’s time and depth underwater. Leaders should make sure all participants understand in advance the minimum equipment requirements for any diving activities, particularly when conducting specialty dives.

#### 10.5.4. <a name='WrongSizeEquipment'></a>Wrong Size Equipment

Divers with ill-fitting equipment that might cause stress or discomfort should be discouraged from diving and asked to obtain equipment that fits. Gear too large or small, such as an exposure suit, is uncomfortable and distracting and may be hazardous.

#### 10.5.5. <a name='WeightingandBallastPlacement'></a>Weighting and Ballast Placement

Divers should be advised to conduct buoyancy checks before descending. Leaders should ask over-ballasted divers to remove weights, and have extra weights available for under-ballasted divers. Generally, all significant weights should be easily jettisoned, such as when affixed to a weight belt, or incorporated into a BC integrated weight system. Remind divers in briefings that wet suits will be progressively less buoyant with depth, and of NAUI’s commitment to Minimum Impact Diving Skills, which includes careful buoyancy control at all times.

#### 10.5.6. <a name='Out-of-AirSituations'></a>Out-of-Air Situations

Discuss air management and suggest that buddies verbally review appropriate methods and procedures for emergency ascent in all briefings. If a buddy does not respond to a diver’s distress, the leader should, whenever possible, make contact with the out-of-air diver, initiate, and control an appropriate out-of-air ascent.

### 10.6. <a name='EnvironmentConditionProblems'></a>Environment Condition Problems

The environment must be considered on every dive. Any dive that does not meet minimum acceptable criteria should be terminated.

#### 10.6.1. <a name='StrongSurf'></a>Strong Surf

Evaluate the safety and comfort of surf entries and exits for all members of the group. Consider wind direction, tidal current action, and forecasts in planning. Observe wave action, such as wave set duration, duration of lull between sets, and force at the site, to aid in decision-making. Postpone or abort any dive if surf conditions are, or are likely to become, unacceptably risky. Leaders must be aware of the tendency of new divers to underestimate the power of surf and the extreme disappointment shown by these divers when a dive is postponed. The leader in charge must not allow students’ displeasure or disappointment to sway the decision to cancel when conditions are marginal or unsafe. Having an alternative dive location as a backup can ease the disappointment of having to abandon a desirable first choice that is environmentally untenable.

#### 10.6.2. <a name='Currents'></a>Currents

Leaders should remind divers to consider current in their dive plans and air consumption calculations. Advise all divers to begin dives against the direction of the current, and to use the current to help them back to their exit point. All divers should be encouraged to carry a whistle or other reliable sound-producing device, as well as an inflatable signaling tube to enable them to more easily indicate difficulty and to aid in their location if retrieval is necessary.

If boat diving, use lines to help divers reach the descent line. Have a longer than usual buoyant trail line with float deployed from the stern of the boat with extra lines and throw-bags on hand. Post lookouts to watch down-current from the dive site. Abort the dive if the current is too strong for the divers on hand, or counsel weaker divers against participating. Know and use the times of maximum current flow and slack water periods in dive planning.
Diver Caught in Current
Attempt to reach the diver with a throw-line. Direct divers to the trail line or an extension of the trail line. Initiate pick-up procedures as feasible.

#### 10.6.3. <a name='PoorVisibility'></a>Poor Visibility

Abort the dive or modify the plan if conditions are unacceptable for adequate supervision, or will be unlikely to be enjoyed. Emphasize buddy contact. Suggest the use of buddy lines if appropriate. Encourage everyone to use the same lost buddy procedures, and review the recommended method.

#### 10.6.4. <a name='SiltyBottom'></a>Silty Bottom

Alert divers in advance to the potential problems of decreasing visibility, and advise them to maintain neutral buoyancy in order to keep their fins off the bottom. Review the recommended “lost buddy” procedures. Leaders may also suggest alternative kicks, such as a relaxed dolphin kick or a bent-leg cave diver’s kick. When life on the bottom will not be damaged, they may also suggest pulling along the bottom with the hands rather than kicking.

#### 10.6.5. <a name='Temperature'></a>Temperature

Water temperatures that are uncomfortable for divers or sharp temperature differences, whether between ambient air and water, or in thermoclines, can induce stress and cause poor performance. Some freshwater lakes and quarries can have temperature differences of 22°C (40°F) through several sharp thermoclines. Advise divers to wear appropriate exposure protection for the dive’s unique conditions.

Leaders should advise students especially to wear their exposure suits only when diving, not at briefings or when transporting gear on hot days, and to remove wet items between dives. Encourage divers to cool themselves by getting wet, staying in the shade and keeping well hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Remind participants that lack of thirst is not an indication that one is successfully avoiding dehydration.

#### 10.6.6. <a name='HazardousAquaticLife'></a>Hazardous Aquatic Life

In the environmental portion of briefings, familiarize divers with hazardous creatures, such as jellyfish, sea urchins, venomous or spined fish, sharp-shelled animals, etc., as well as more common benign ones. Encourage caution in hand placement, buoyancy control, and the wearing of protective clothing. Promote diving primarily as a visual activity: “Look, but don’t touch” is good advice for divers most of the time. Divers should be cautioned not to poke at or disturb unknown creatures in an attempt to see what reaction will occur.

### 10.7. <a name='SkillProblems'></a>Skill Problems

Certification levels, experience and actual skill will vary greatly among individual divers in any group. Problems occur when divers or students seemingly forget basic skills. Calm reassurance by a leader is generally sufficient to help them remember if the skill was truly learned previously. Leaders should avoid adding to the diver’s stress while helping to resolve the problem.

#### 10.7.1. <a name='DiverUnabletoClearMask'></a>Diver Unable to Clear Mask

Attempt to correct the skill problem underwater by checking mask seal and strap, and calming the diver so they can attempt to clear again. Leaders should concentrate on the diver, and may demonstrate the procedure without actually flooding their own mask. If the diver remains unable to clear the mask, maintain firm physical contact with the diver while ascending to the surface. Be prepared to control the diver if panicked flight is attempted.

#### 10.7.2. <a name='DiverUnabletoClearRegulator'></a>Diver Unable to Clear Regulator

Any diver experiencing difficulty drawing air from a regulator underwater is a candidate for panic. Leaders should escort such divers directly to the surface while maintaining firm physical contact and be prepared to share air with the affected diver. If the problem is resolved before the surface and the diver is once again breathing normally and under control, the dive may resume.

#### 10.7.3. <a name='PoorBuoyancyControl'></a>Poor Buoyancy Control

Divers who are unable to control their buoyancy should be monitored closely. Depending on the area, such as when wall diving or where there are sharp drop-offs, leaders may have to signal divers to terminate the dive and accompany them to the surface to discuss the problem.

### 10.8. <a name='Counseling'></a>Counseling

A NAUI member’s goal in counseling is to help divers cope intelligently with diving-related problems they are experiencing, or may be causing. Counseling focuses on helping divers improve and enjoy safer diving through education about skills, practices, and abilities.

Diving leaders’ behavior, attitude, and counseling efforts should indicate their genuine concerns for divers’ safety. Counseling research points to the caring relationship between the counselor and client as the most important factor in successful problem resolution. Considering this, it is important for divers to perceive leaders as concerned with their well-being, rather than in charge of their behavior.
Nonjudgmental Attitude
In order to effectively counsel divers and guide them towards recognizing and solving their own diving problems, leaders must be careful not to project disapproval or impatience, no matter how basic or seemingly insignificant the problem may appear.

#### 10.8.1. <a name='ReflectiveListening'></a>Reflective Listening

An effective way to demonstrate sensitivity during counseling is reflective listening. When a person expresses a concept, leaders can show understanding by restating what the person has said. Examples include, “If I understand you correctly, you feel the problem is...,”,“Am I correct in assuming you feel the problem stems from...,” and “So you feel the best course of action is to...?”

#### 10.8.2. <a name='MaintainingEyeContact'></a>Maintaining Eye Contact

Maintain eye contact with individuals during counseling, unless this seems to make them more stressed. Problems often embarrass an individual, and a person may misconstrue attention as accusation unless the leader is especially careful to react to the diver in a positive and friendly manner.

Group Decision-Making and Intervention
When a situation affects an entire group of divers, leaders have the option to consider alternative courses of action by themselves or in conjunction with others.

Everyone does not have to agree completely with the plan, but all should contribute to its development and be able to support most of it. An effective leader must have the ability to make decisions and to lead discussions to obtain a consensus. This may be difficult in a situation where a few experienced divers must give way to the needs of a group of less experienced participants, yet the leader’s responsibility to help all divers present enjoy the activity makes this necessary.

If a diver from your group engages in a breach of safety, discuss the issue with the individual privately. Do not use people in any dive group as bad examples, even if they exhibit unruly or uncooperative behavior.

#### 10.8.3. <a name='WhenCounselingFails'></a>When Counseling Fails

Sometimes the most reasonable, well-meaning efforts to help guide divers to appropriate choices fail. NAUI leaders may not physically restrain anyone from diving or any other behavior, unless there will be definite physical injury or unequivocal harm to the individual or other persons or the leader’s professional responsibility to maintain safety standards is clearly compromised. In the unlikely event that this ever happens, for instance an obviously inebriated or otherwise temporarily impaired diver insisting on participating in a dive, or someone behaving in an overtly physically threatening way towards another, the responding leader should be prepared to document actions taken in writing with corroboration by witnesses.

## 11. <a name='PreventingDivingAccidents'></a>Preventing Diving Accidents

### 11.1. <a name='Introduction-1'></a>Introduction

Despite more comprehensive diving knowledge, more effective training methods, better equipment, and excellent leadership, diving accidents still happen. One reason is that divers are still human. NAUI leaders can use this information to prevent diving mishaps in two ways:

- By using it to assess individual’s risk in diving and excluding them from instruction or participation as appropriate.
- By assessing divers before and during activities to identify and deal with problems that can contribute to diving accidents.

Both physiology and psychology have a wide range of considerations that affect an individual’s ability to participate in diving.

- Absolute contraindications are those that totally disqualify a person from scuba diving now and at any time in the future.
- Relative contraindications are those that prevent an individual from participating without explicit medical approval from a diving physician or licensed medical practitioner, or that may require modification in training, equipment, and/or diving techniques or parameters to allow participation as appropriate to the diver’s condition or ability.
- Temporary contraindications disqualify a diver from participating while the factors are present.
  - Relative and temporary contraindications are often subject to an individual participant’s and leader’s judgment at the time of an activity. Leaders must use their professional judgment to decide to what extent such factors affect a specific individual’s risk and probable direct threat to others’ safety including their own.

### 11.2. <a name='AssessingDivingFitness'></a>Assessing Diving Fitness

NAUI’s Risk Management Handbook and Medical History Form, routinely used with students, are the chief tools used to guide leaders in assessing an individual’s diving fitness. The medical form is designed so that a physician and prospective student can determine whether there is anything in that person’s medical history or current condition that make participation in underwater instruction unduly hazardous and a probable direct threat to others. In order to use this form properly, and in order to make field decisions about the participation of certified divers without benefit of a completed medical form, NAUI leaders must develop and apply their ability to identify and evaluate physical and mental factors that may adversely affect diver safety.

### 11.3. <a name='FacingDiversWhoShouldNotDive'></a>Facing Divers Who Should Not Dive

Individual NAUI leaders will be the best judges of how to deal with persons who should not dive in any actual situation. While a doctor’s signature on a medical form or a diver’s experience, insistence, and willingness to assume the risk may relieve some legal responsibility, NAUI members still have a moral obligation to do what is best for all the divers with whom they are working. A person putting him or herself at unacceptable risk, or whose physical and/or mental condition distracts attention from or may endanger the group at large, should not be diving under the responsibility of a NAUI leader.

One aspect of leadership is the ability to make correct decisions, however difficult they may be. If (or when) such persons have an accident or contribute to someone else’s injury, the leader must then face the grieving family of a dead or stricken diver, besides their lawyer and perhaps a jury.

Worse still, leaders must deal with their own consciences after allowing someone to dive who probably should not have done so. NAUI leaders should help such persons understand why diving is not a good activity choice for them. Though unpleasant and restrictive, dissuading someone from diving is probably the only absolutely effective method of accident prevention.

If counseling is ineffective, it may be possible to refer them to someone, such as a qualified hyperbaric physician, for additional education about the issue that prevents their participation. Ultimately, NAUI members must refuse to teach or lead individuals who are likely to cause harm to others.

### 11.4. <a name='PhysicalFactors'></a>Physical Factors

Absolute physical contraindications can be divided into three main groups:

1. Conditions that can cause sudden loss of consciousness or incapacitation, such as seizure disorders or fainting.
1. Conditions that may cause a problem underwater, though not necessarily on land, such as asthma or other lung diseases.
1. Conditions that are adversely affected by higher than normal pressure or that make equalizing pressure excessively difficult or impossible.

#### 11.4.1. <a name='SuddenLossofConsciousnessorIncapacitation'></a>Sudden Loss of Consciousness or Incapacitation

Loss of consciousness underwater usually leads to death by drowning. Examples of disqualifying diseases that can cause these problems are seizure disorders (like epilepsy), coronary disease, arteriosclerosis, and insulin-dependent diabetes.

In cases of insulin-dependent diabetes, there is always the risk of unexpected exertion and exercise-induced sudden drop in blood sugar.

#### 11.4.2. <a name='AsthmaandOtherLungDiseases'></a>Asthma and Other Lung Diseases

Any lung disease is an absolute contraindication to diving, despite the fact that the afflicted person may be capable of ordinary, or even extraordinary, physical activities.

Asthma, also known as reactive airway disease, is a contraindication to diving for several reasons. During attacks, asthmatics cannot adequately ventilate because small airways close, trapping inhaled air. However unintentional, asthmatics with an attack on ascent, or who have an attack and accidentally ascend, are holding their breath. The same is true of emphysemics who experience similar inability to exhale fully, and who may have air trapped in lungs that have become less pliant due to disease.

### 11.5. <a name='RelativeContraindications'></a>Relative Contraindications

Many relative contraindications to diving are controversial within the diving community. Many disabled individuals with conditions as diverse as paralysis from spinal injury, cerebral palsy, and blindness participate in diving despite the increased challenges they face.

NAUI leaders must require the individual to present a valid Medical History Form before accepting any such person as a student.

Whenever possible, NAUI leaders should personally consult with the physician to elicit recommendations for appropriate modifications of the course or activity to as much as possible reduce risk to the challenged individual and any other participants. Physicians should also advise leaders and participants in writing of any time limits to their approval, such as with persons with progressive diseases, and of the recommended interval before reevaluation for continued participation, if any. Any recommended modifications that affect NAUI Standards must be approved by the NAUI Worldwide Training Department. NAUI certification is determined by an individual’s ability to meet certification requirements; a disability, in and of itself, does not affect whether a student achieves certification as a diver.

#### 11.5.1. <a name='HiddenProblems'></a>Hidden Problems

Since scuba diving, even under the most ideal conditions, exposes people to some risk of decompression illness (DCI), that is, decompression sickness (DCS) or arterial gas embolism (AGE), leaders must be able to recognize those problems and provide appropriate care should they occur. There are some conditions that are relative contraindications to diving because they interfere with the usual presentations of these diving illnesses. Decompression sickness, if it occurs, may not present any symptoms that can be felt by the diver or signs that can be observed by the diving leader.

None of these factors absolutely disqualifies people from diving. However, their presence does mean that if these individuals choose to dive, they must do so with a full knowledge and assumption of the increased risk they face.

### 11.6. <a name='TemporaryContraindications'></a>Temporary Contraindications

There are many temporary conditions that can increase the risk of diving while they are in effect.

#### 11.6.1. <a name='ColdsandCongestion'></a>Colds and Congestion

Acute diseases can temporarily render anyone unfit to dive. Divers with a “cold,” chest congestion, or other illnesses often take medications and try to dive despite knowing better. Others may take decongestants or use nasal inhalants routinely to avoid problems with equalization. Leaders should question divers seen taking oral or inhalant decongestants. Depending on the reason they are doing so, it may require counseling divers to refrain from diving or from taking the drugs. The sedative properties of some of these drugs have the potential to make people more susceptible to nitrogen narcosis, negatively affecting underwater performance. When decongestants are taken, especially routinely, there is always the chance of the drug effect wearing off underwater, and the condition for which they were taken returning more strongly. Reverse blocks and other problems can ensue. Perhaps more important, decongestants may temporarily resolve the problem of ear and sinus equalization but not the chest congestion of a cold. The viral infection from a cold or “flu” can cause changes in lung function for up to six weeks post symptomatic display, giving a potentially greater risk of pulmonary damage from diving.

Diving leaders should never advise divers who may have difficulty equalizing to use any drug to aid the process. Taking medicine to dive is clearly foolish, and leaders should strongly discourage divers who would.

#### 11.6.2. <a name='Medications'></a>Medications

With the abundance of prescription drugs available, it is unreasonable to expect to know what each medication encountered among divers is used for, but there are many ways to find out. One is simply to ask the person. A better way is to ask to speak with the prescribing physician. Leaders can also use sources such as hyperbaric facilities or knowledgeable diving physicians. If the query cannot be answered locally, calling the DAN non-emergency number, for consultation is another alternative.

#### 11.6.3. <a name='RecentHospitalization'></a>Recent Hospitalization

This is another possible temporary contraindication that can be resolved with a simple question. People may frequently forget to connect a recent hospital stay with an activity now that they are “healthy.” However, there can be a wide difference between being released from a hospital after treatment for say, smoke inhalation, and an individual’s fitness to dive. Any conditions of the lung caused by illness, severe injuries, or surgery can have lingering effects that affect a diver’s risk. Such persons should be strongly encouraged to get a complete physical from a diving physician prior to resuming diving. Stress to divers and students that there are other activities to enjoy until they are fully fit for diving.

#### 11.6.4. <a name='Pregnancy'></a>Pregnancy

Pregnant women should not dive. There is no way to diagnose or treat any diving illness in an unborn child, nor is there any knowledge of what constitute acceptable exposures, if any.

### 11.7. <a name='PsychologicalFactors'></a>Psychological Factors

Besides physical ability, a sound mind and stable personality are fundamental prerequisites to diving safety. The ability to achieve comfort in the water, the goal of every diver, is as much a state of mind as skill proficiency. Comfortable divers are knowledgeable, confident, and disciplined. They are able to acquire the multi-faceted knowledge that comprises diving information and apply it to their dive planning.

#### 11.7.1. <a name='PsychologicalContraindications'></a>Psychological Contraindications

Unlike physical problems, mental limitations and psychological factors that mitigate an individual’s diving fitness are frequently less apparent. They may also shift more easily between categories of absolute, relative, and temporary contraindications to diving.

#### 11.7.2. <a name='SevereMentalIllness'></a>Severe Mental Illness

Profound mental illness that has irrationality as a component is an absolute contraindication to diving, even if previously certified. Persons with severe mental disorders such as schizophrenia or similar problems should not dive. One of the hallmarks of these problems is a lack of contact with reality. While diving is an excellent escape from the routine problems of the day-to-day world, divers must remain tied to the real-world concepts of time, pressure, and distance–aspects of reality that schizophrenics may not accept.

The common medications used to control these mental disabilities may tend to lower the brain’s threshold for seizure, so even someone whose psychiatric symptoms are well controlled with medication is at increased risk. Finally, a significant part of the buddy system relies upon a predictability of behavior that may be impossible for the psychotic, putting them and their partners in jeopardy.

#### 11.7.3. <a name='DepressionandAnxiety'></a>Depression and Anxiety

Lesser mental diseases, such as anxiety neuroses and depression, can be even more difficult to assess than subtle physical issues, yet they may be more common and even more dangerous. Diving can be stressful as well as pleasurable and may worsen the problems of the anxious person. A person suffering from extreme anxiety can literally become paralyzed in a situation perceived as threatening–unable to act or even move from fear. Medications used for the reduction of anxiety may even increase the sedating effects of nitrogen narcosis.

#### 11.7.4. <a name='DrugAbuseandDependency'></a>Drug Abuse and Dependency

Many people use drugs recreationally, including alcohol, or attempt to medicate themselves improperly with prescription or over-the-counter medicine. Abuse of any such drug disqualifies an individual from diving.

Smoking tobacco, marijuana, hashish, or opium can have similar adverse effects on lung tissue and organ function, as well as negative perceptual and psychological consequences. Tobacco can also create other serious health problems such as emphysema and heart disease. Long-term, habitual, abuse of any drug is generally incompatible with diving safety.

All substance abusers should be strongly discouraged from diving. Moreover, even the presence of illegal drugs aboard a vessel can result in serious legal problems, including seizure of the vessel.

#### 11.7.5. <a name='StressandPanic'></a>Stress and Panic

NAUI leaders must recognize and respond to the signs and symptoms of excessive diver stress to help prevent diving accidents. According to statistics compiled by the Divers Alert Network (DAN) and the University of Rhode Island in the U.S., drowning due to panic appears to be the leading cause of diving fatalities. Lung over-expansion injuries, the second leading cause of diver death, are also generally caused by panic resulting in an uncontrolled ascent.

Panic can be the end result of any combination of stresses that affect a diver’s ability and performance. These individual stresses can be caused by many factors, which, as they accumulate without abatement, can overwhelm a diver. Poor dive planning, training deficiencies, inefficient underwater techniques, unexpected problems, fitness issues, fatigue and individual fears are all possible components of excessive stress. What may cause excessive stress, and what that may mean to any diver’s performance is unique to every diver and every situation. By understanding the nature of stress and its complex physiological and psychological bases, NAUI leaders can better help divers avoid it as a means of preventing diving accidents.

#### 11.7.6. <a name='Stress'></a>Stress

It is important to note that reaction to stress at some level is perfectly normal and healthy. Stress is the body’s and mind’s reaction to any external stimulus that disturbs normal equilibrium.

A limited amount of stress before a dive, for instance, can make the diver more sensitive to the problems and required procedures of preparation. If this stress becomes excessive, however, and is compounded by problems upon entering the water, it can lead to distress and disability. Accumulated, unchecked stress that surpasses the individual’s ability to cope is dangerous and can easily cause panic.

#### 11.7.7. <a name='Panic'></a>Panic

Panic is an emotional, physical, and volatile human reaction that occurs in the presence of real or imagined danger. It is characterized by a total loss of logic and mental control. A truly panicked individual’s responses are limited to achieving one goal: immediate escape from the threat by any means available.

Panicked divers are almost impossible to assist. They are incapable of helping themselves and may severely harm others in their unreasoning quest for “safety,” whatever that may be perceived as at a given moment.

By being able to detect the telltale signs of apprehension, NAUI leaders may be able to help others begin to avoid panic before the dive even begins.

### 11.8. <a name='PreventingandControllingStress'></a>Preventing and Controlling Stress

Awareness of stress factors and leadership action to intervene to reduce or modify their impact on divers will help reduce diving accidents. Preventing excessive stress in divers requires NAUI leaders to use many skills, chief among which is the ability to observe behavior and empathize with divers’ experiencing stress.

#### 11.8.1. <a name='RecognizingPre-DiveStressBehaviors'></a>Recognizing Pre-Dive Stress Behaviors

Experienced assistant instructors, divemasters, and instructors rely upon certain behavioral clues to detect nervous divers. Prospective NAUI leaders should learn to spot these signs of stress to prevent divers from entering the panic state with its possible disastrous results.

#### 11.8.2. <a name='Introversion'></a>Introversion

Diving is a social event. When individuals do not participate in group activities, nervousness and fear may be present and increase through self-imposed isolation. The student or diver who withdraws from the rest of the group and remains unusually quiet throughout the day might be dwelling on the possible negative aspects of the dive.

#### 11.8.3. <a name='MentalErrors'></a>Mental Errors

Divers who are excessively nervous will often make simple mistakes. Placing the regulator on the cylinder backwards, leaving the inflator unconnected, or forgetting the weight belt are just a few of the many mistakes that can occur. Though one mistake should not cause alarm, when a series of errors are committed, the diver may be over-stressed. Diving leaders must deal sensitively with these situations. Leaders should avoid over-emphasizing the seriousness of the problem in the person’s view or embarrassing the individual, while correcting any miscues or gear handling errors and assessing their diving fitness.

#### 11.8.4. <a name='Forgetfulness'></a>Forgetfulness

There is much to be remembered for a scuba dive. It is easy to overlook something. But when a diver forgets several items (bathing suit, mask, wetsuit, money), it can indicate deeper nervousness and apprehension. This may be particularly true, for instance, when an individual has checklists and does not use them.

#### 11.8.5. <a name='FalseBravado'></a>False Bravado

Many competent divers are ashamed and embarrassed when they experience what they may regard as undue apprehension before a dive. To mask the fear, they will often brag about how easy the dive will be, make a big joke about the entire experience, or tell tales of harrowing experiences they have survived or heard about. These people probably possess more anxiety than they would like to admit. So-called “macho” divers, whether male or female, may not possess the supreme self-confidence they affect, but may instead be extremely nervous and just attempting to fool others and themselves by masking their fear with such behavior.

#### 11.8.6. <a name='Irritability'></a>Irritability

Some divers, particularly students on the day of the first open water dive, display a loss of patience and a quick temper. Any slight change in plans or delay may propel these people into a mild tantrum or worse. Sudden out of proportion irritability is quite possibly a manifestation of built-up stress.

#### 11.8.7. <a name='PerceptualNarrowing'></a>Perceptual Narrowing

When exposed to higher than normal stress levels, people will often fixate on only one issue of many they should be monitoring. This perceptual narrowing may manifest itself in many ways, such as a diver repeatedly checking the time in preparation for a dive or forgetting to turn on the air cylinder or making a deeper dive focusing solely on the depth gauge and ignoring the submersible pressure gauge. Perceptual narrowing due to stress is commonly the reason many divers cannot recall maximum depths or bottom times after diving in a new site, or to a deeper-than-accustomed-depth or participating in a new activity.

#### 11.8.8. <a name='DealingWithDiverStress'></a>Dealing With Diver Stress

Excessive stress distracts divers’ concentration away from the specific requirements of diving and increases the chance for mishap. If divers display stressed behavior before the dive begins, the dive leaders must intervene to eliminate or reduce the stressing factors.

#### 11.8.9. <a name='Listening'></a>Listening

Listening to divers’ concerns is perhaps the first step in reducing excessive stress. Giving divers the opportunity to express themselves without interruption is essential, as is being non-judgmental and supportive. When nervous divers admit they are nervous, helping them is not difficult. Patient explanation and consideration of the problems they are raising often resolves their stress. When nervous students or divers hide their emotions and do not talk to the dive leader, it is difficult to assist them. It’s imperative that divers feel the leader is approachable and empathetic with their concerns.

#### 11.8.10. <a name='Talking'></a>Talking

Since fear of the unknown or unexpected is a significant cause of stress, explaining all the dive procedures is perhaps the most efficient way to reduce diver stress. Leaders should, however, avoid drawing excessive attention to any diver’s nervousness. Conversation should be friendly, informative, full of encouragement, and at times even humorous. It’s difficult to feel stressed while laughing.

#### 11.8.11. <a name='AccentuatethePositive'></a>Accentuate the Positive

Many divers become highly stressed because they dwell on an activity’s negative aspects, even the possible negative consequences of diving in general. This is particularly true of open water training dives. In order to combat this, leaders should emphasize all positive aspects of the dive (the good weather, the unusually good visibility, or the amazing sights) and deal with the activity’s risks in a calm, realistic, and matter-of-fact way.

#### 11.8.12. <a name='FightDistractionWithDistraction'></a>Fight Distraction With Distraction

Excessive stress distracts divers from functioning properly because they cannot focus on the essential tasks of the dive. One way to eliminate this distraction is to give the divers something to do while diving to distract them from their nervousness. Some examples are helping to collect samples, identifying certain forms of marine life, and keeping track of water temperature. Divers should not, however, be overburdened with chores or busy-work that can increase their stress.

An excellent and useful underwater activity, particularly for training dives, is to have participants chart their dive’s profile underwater on a slate, including remaining air pressure readings. Setting up columns on their slate on the surface, divers fill in the blanks at periodic intervals while diving. This reinforces checking the console for important information on depth, time and air consumption, and provides useful data for examination at the surface during the interval while planning the next dive.

#### 11.8.13. <a name='TeamWeakWithStrong'></a>Team Weak With Strong

Pair potentially stressed divers with strong, confident divers, preferably talkative and responsible persons who go out of their way to be helpful. Leaders should be aware however, that the stressed diver is a very weak buddy should the stronger diver need assistance. When making such pairings, the stronger diver should be so informed and willing to assume the risk.

#### 11.8.14. <a name='CalmingExercises'></a>Calming Exercises

There is a strong relationship between breath control, stress reduction, and underwater performance. Good breath control and conscious relaxation are two other tools leaders may employ to reduce stress and maximize enjoyment while scuba diving.

### 11.9. <a name='LeadershipPresenceandAction'></a>Leadership Presence and Action

NAUI leaders can wield tremendous influence on diver’s stress simply by their own behavior. Calm, professional behavior and well-planned and executed activities inspire and calm divers. Like the competent leader, they feel confident and capable. Obvious expressions of concern, fear, or anxiety from an ill-prepared leader are infectious to all. Even when dealing with problems or expressing concern, leaders should strive to maintain a friendly and encouraging manner. This kind of behavior can help calm nervous divers and avoids making a bad situation worse.

Leaders dealing with their own stressful responsibilities can use the following progression to better copy with their tasks:

**Stop**
**Breathe**
**Think**
**Breathe**
**Act**

Leaders can frequently aid stressed divers by modifying the dive’s parameters. This can include ascending to a shallower depth, stopping underwater to relax, or curtailing an exercise when working with students.

Above all, if leaders are unable to help divers cope with excessive stress before dives, they must have enough courage to tell people why they should not dive. As unpleasant as this may seem, a NAUI leader’s commitment to safe diving requires that “accidents waiting to happen” be prevented to keep from endangering themselves and others.

### 11.10. <a name='EarlyWarningSignsofIn-WaterStress'></a>Early Warning Signs of In-Water Stress

This section addresses common in-water early warning signs that a NAUI leader should recognize and react to in order to prevent accidents. Leaders should understand that stress is unique to each diver, though it may have a common appearance, and may not necessarily lead to panic. It is therefore mandatory to judge the level of response that a particular problem requires with any diver. Leaders should also remember that helping distressed divers poses a significant risk to themselves, and helping divers avoid early stress is an excellent way to avoid having to deal with a panicked diver.

#### 11.10.1. <a name='InefficientBreathing'></a>Inefficient Breathing

Stress alters breathing. Divers under stress tend to breathe rapidly and shallowly. Divers who complain of post-dive headaches are often victims of carbon dioxide build-up due to inefficient breathing. Leaders should counsel these divers on breathing techniques, and assess the problem’s causes.

#### 11.10.2. <a name='InefficientSwimming'></a>Inefficient Swimming

Once in the water, a stressed diver may display other behavioral patterns. Rather than moving through the water smoothly and slowly to conserve air and energy, a highly stressed diver will swim erratically.

Inefficient swimming manifests itself in many ways, but frequently begins wi`th attempting to swim forward while in a vertical position. The diver will use a bicycle or stair-climbing style, up-and-down fin motion, instead of a smooth flutter kick. Usually the arms and legs will move wildly, albeit ineffectively, as the diver becomes excited. At the surface, the highly stressed diver may kick hard enough to be nearly waist-high out of the water, rapidly becoming fatigued.

A person in this state is clearly too nervous to dive and should be assisted from the water, at least ensuring that there will be no accident. Surface counseling and possible activity postponement are recommended. Try to learn what sequence of events led to the situation and deal with it in small segments if possible.

#### 11.10.3. <a name='EquipmentRejection'></a>Equipment Rejection

Divers who are highly stressed can lose faith in their equipment. While at the surface, the diver may quickly and abruptly remove the mask and regulator. Underwater, the diver may continually readjust one piece of gear, like the weight belt or BC straps. A stressed diver may even reject the regulator underwater, a serious situation that demands an immediate response to replace the regulator, then stabilize and escort the diver from the water to discuss the problem.

While a mask should be worn on the face and a regulator mouthpiece belongs in the mouth, yelling at the diver when these are elsewhere only creates more stress. Mask-on-the-forehead has often been regarded as a sign of stress, which it may or may not be. However, yelling at a diver whose mask is on their forehead may produce stress as well as embarrassment. Leaders can help themselves assess when this is a result of stress by emphasizing in classes and briefings that the mask should be worn on the face while in the water and that wearing it on the forehead is a good way to lose it as well as get an unexpected face-full of water. A leader who sees the mask on a diver’s forehead should observe the diver carefully for possible stress.

#### 11.10.4. <a name='WildEyes'></a>Wild Eyes

Many divers appear quite wide-eyed when stressed. Their eyes can appear to be non-seeing or unfocused. Good leaders learn with experience that the eyes can reveal a diver’s condition. Wide, rapidly moving eyes and impulsive blinking may indicate a person suffering from a high level of stress who should be approached carefully. Eyes often confirm stress suggested by other signs.

### 11.11. <a name='FitnessforDiving'></a>Fitness for Diving

One cannot discuss dive accident prevention without talking about simple physical fitness. It is one factor that can be enhanced by every person. Physically fit divers have more fun. They enjoy diving because they do not work as hard when they dive, and few people consider stressful hard work to be fun. Divers should gain ability in four areas: aerobic power, strength, flexibility, and specific skills.

#### 11.11.1. <a name='AerobicTrainingRange'></a>Aerobic Training Range

More people than ever before are engaging in regular aerobic activity: running, swimming, walking, stair climbing, rowing, cycling–a huge variety of sports. NAUI leaders can help divers improve their aerobic fitness and diving comfort by encouraging them to do exercises that push their heart rate into the “training range” a minimum of three times per week.

#### 11.11.2. <a name='WeightTraining'></a>Weight Training

Dive gear is heavy! Many accidents occur because individuals fail to control a heavy tank or weight belt, have trouble getting back onto the boat or out of the water, or difficulty managing heavy gear while maintaining their balance.

In any event, diving requires specific kinds of strength. For instance, it takes leg power to stand up wearing a full set of gear, and it takes arm strength to haul oneself along a line. Strength training two to three times per week is ideal and will yield results. One need not look like a classic body-builder or weight-lifting champion to dive comfortably, but divers should strive for useful strength, including upper body as well as legs, to enhance their diving enjoyment and increase their safety.

#### 11.11.3. <a name='StretchingandFlexibility'></a>Stretching and Flexibility

Flexibility cannot only save a dive, but also a diver’s life. A lack of flexibility can be life-threatening if a diver cannot solve a gear problem because tight muscles and joints prevent reaching it. Other unexpected events also happen. A physically flexible diver can slip and do an impromptu near-split without injury, while a tight diver may tear a muscle.

There are several good stretching programs available which can help prevent injury. Remember when stretching to do so slowly, and only gradually increase tension. This will help prevent injury to tight muscles and connective tissue such as ligaments and tendons. Regardless of the extent of one’s flexibility, one should stretch only to the point of discomfort, not actual pain. To ignore either of these is to invite debilitating injury.

#### 11.11.4. <a name='Nutrition'></a>Nutrition

Proper diet and nutrition are other important aspects of a good fitness program. Besides personal weight control, attention to diet can improve health, energy, and stamina.

#### 11.11.5. <a name='ScubaDivingforFitness'></a>Scuba Diving for Fitness

In sports medicine, the final aspect of conditioning is skill-specific training. While overall aerobic conditioning, strength, flexibility, and nutrition are the foundations of fitness, the final level is practicing the specific skills used in diving activity. The best final preparation for diving is diving. By diving, two separate goals are accomplished: one relearns and polishes diving skills.

In all of your professional activities, whether teaching people to dive, assisting with diving instruction, or conducting or supervising dives for certified divers, you as a NAUI leader must always be aware that your goal and responsibility are the promotion of safe, enjoyable diving. As a NAUI leader, you must be continually aware of your divers or diving students, the environment, and the dive or activity. Preventing accidents and furthering safe diving is a trust given you when you become a NAUI leader.

## Risk Management and Insurance

### Introduction

The conduct of NAUI leaders as trained recreational dive professionals is subject to many of the same moral, ethical, and legal requirements as other professionals, such as teachers or health care workers. With the right to offer your services to the public as a NAUI leader come both personal and professional accountability. NAUI leaders are required to act responsibly and correctly as they practice their craft. If they do not, they may face the consequences of a civil suit for damages, just as any other professional might be sued for malpractice or negligence. In extreme cases of malfeasance or neglect leading to death or serious injury, criminal charges are possible.

Your character and NAUI training will help you meet the responsibilities of leadership and will help you make good decisions appropriate to professional conduct and your activities. Your constant vigilance, expertise, and skill will most likely prevent any accidents, just as has been the case throughout the careers of the vast majority of NAUI leaders. Yet skin and scuba diving are inherently risky activities. If someone is injured during a training or diving activity in which you are involved in a leadership role, you may very likely be sued. A legal action against you may also result if a person whom you trained is later injured while engaging in a personal diving activity. Managing these legal risks begins with understanding and meeting your professional obligations.
