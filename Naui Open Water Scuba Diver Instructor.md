# Naui Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor

## Dive Safety Through Education 

### Introduction

Since its inception, NAUI members have earned a worldwide reputation for quality scuba leadership. Our organization has continued to attract the best minds in diving because of our continuing emphasis on quality. It is this reputation for excellence that likely contributed to your decision to seek membership. As a member, you will profit from this high public regard. You will also be expected to help maintain this reputation by working conscientiously to improve diving safety through education of others and through your personal commitment to continuing education. Few people are fortunate enough to earn a living doing what they love to do. Earning membership in NAUI will create opportunities to work in exotic locations and share your love of diving with a variety of people from all over the world.

### National Association of Underwater Instructors

Unlike other diving certification organizations, NAUI is a worldwide, democratic, membership association dedicated to serving the public. NAUI is democratic in that our instructor members elect the Board of Directors, who represent the membership and establish policies and directions for our association. Our corporate mission statement is paraphrased as our stated purpose, which is “to enable people to enjoy underwater activities as safely as possible by providing the highest quality practical education, and to actively promote the preservation and protection of the world’s underwater environments.” Every person who becomes a NAUI member pledges him or herself to follow and to further this purpose.

When you earn a NAUI leadership rating and join the Association, you will gain the rights and privileges of membership appropriate to your level. Along with these rights, you assume responsibilities as detailed in the NAUI Standards and Policies Manual. As a leadership candidate, you should be thoroughly familiar with the information in this manual, and especially with the sections on NAUI Ethics and the NAUI Credo. Both will help you understand what NAUI means to its members. Our Association thrives on the diversity and enthusiasm that each new member brings to every level. The discoveries, innovations, ideas, and camaraderie you will share with other members are fundamental to NAUI’s strength and preeminence within the diving community.
Desire alone does not ensure NAUI leadership certification. The training is a challenging process of growth and self-discovery; receiving your NAUI certificate will be a noteworthy success. It will mean that you have performed to the very limit of your ability, and that you are committed to doing so throughout your career as a diving leader.

The Membership Agreement you will be asked to read and sign when you join is an example of how seriously NAUI members take their responsibility to maintain the Association’s reputation and high quality service to divers and students. It asks you to grant our Membership Review Committee the right to investigate and recommend disciplinary action if you do not behave professionally as a member and abide by NAUI’s Code of Ethics. You will be expected to follow and support the collective will and mind of the membership as expressed in our Standards and Policies Manual. This obligation also includes, however, the freedom to define how to best fulfill leadership responsibilities and develop your own professional style and teaching methods. Members’ individuality and unique contributions are highly valued.

### NAUI Leadership Training

The primary goal of NAUI leadership training is to help you become a valuable member and as successful a diving leader as you can be. This training has four aspects:

1. Acquiring diving knowledge and developing the ability to perform and demonstrate specific essential water skills.
1. Learning leadership skills and developing an effective personal leadership style through study and the observation of other leaders.
1. Benefiting from evaluation and coaching on all aspects of leadership responsibilities.
Gaining experience through exercising leadership skills under the supervision and guidance of a NAUI Instructor.

### Developing Leaders

No one can make a leader, but there are traits associated with the display of leadership. Training can help you identify and develop these traits within yourself. Once identified and understood, it will be your responsibility to nurture these qualities as you progress in leadership training throughout your career as a NAUI member and professional diver. NAUI leadership training will give you the tools that will enable you to develop your own techniques for working more effectively with divers, but you will develop your leadership ability in accord with your own personality, values, and style.

### Personal Leadership Styles and Values

Our conscious behavior is based upon our values and personality. Value (the worth that we ascribe to anything) derives from what we learn by observing our families, friends, culture, and world experience as filtered through our personalities. Personality is the sum of our talents, predisposition and experiences. We learn a great deal by observing the behavior of others, some of which we adapt to our personal style. But, as we evolve and become more confident and mature, we also reject some behaviors as unsuitable and undesirable.

Attitudes (how we feel about things) govern our behavior. The development of an appropriate system of values and proper leadership attitudes is as vital to meeting membership responsibility as the acquisition of knowledge and skills.

The process of leadership training is a continuation of your development as an individual. You will learn that observation, reflection, insight, and realization are as important to the process as study. You will become your version of a leader through a process of assimilation, adapting and modifying everything you learn. Some facets of your trainers’ leadership styles may impress you. Some of their techniques will be valuable as examples of effective leadership skills. However, not all of their styles or techniques may work for you. More important than picking up “tricks of the trade” is working in a leadership program that will show you how established members meet their leadership responsibilities.

Like all NAUI leaders, you will regularly deal with the lives and well being of students and divers. You must develop an attitude that places concern for their safety at the highest level. Minimally competent divers are urged to improve in the same way that NAUI leaders are charged to constantly improve their own competence. Published minimum standards of achievement are treated as goals to be acquired and exceeded. NAUI leaders find satisfaction and enjoyment in inspiring divers to develop well beyond the minimum standards.
