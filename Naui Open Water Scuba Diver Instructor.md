# Naui Open Water Scuba Diver Instructor

## 1. <a name='DiveSafetyThroughEducation'></a>Dive Safety Through Education

### 1.1. <a name='Introduction'></a>Introduction

Since its inception, NAUI members have earned a worldwide reputation for quality scuba leadership. Our organization has continued to attract the best minds in diving because of our continuing emphasis on quality. It is this reputation for excellence that likely contributed to your decision to seek membership. As a member, you will profit from this high public regard. You will also be expected to help maintain this reputation by working conscientiously to improve diving safety through education of others and through your personal commitment to continuing education. Few people are fortunate enough to earn a living doing what they love to do. Earning membership in NAUI will create opportunities to work in exotic locations and share your love of diving with a variety of people from all over the world.

### 1.2. <a name='NationalAssociationofUnderwaterInstructors'></a>National Association of Underwater Instructors

Unlike other diving certification organizations, NAUI is a worldwide, democratic, membership association dedicated to serving the public. NAUI is democratic in that our instructor members elect the Board of Directors, who represent the membership and establish policies and directions for our association. Our corporate mission statement is paraphrased as our stated purpose, which is “to enable people to enjoy underwater activities as safely as possible by providing the highest quality practical education, and to actively promote the preservation and protection of the world’s underwater environments.” Every person who becomes a NAUI member pledges him or herself to follow and to further this purpose.

When you earn a NAUI leadership rating and join the Association, you will gain the rights and privileges of membership appropriate to your level. Along with these rights, you assume responsibilities as detailed in the NAUI Standards and Policies Manual. As a leadership candidate, you should be thoroughly familiar with the information in this manual, and especially with the sections on NAUI Ethics and the NAUI Credo. Both will help you understand what NAUI means to its members. Our Association thrives on the diversity and enthusiasm that each new member brings to every level. The discoveries, innovations, ideas, and camaraderie you will share with other members are fundamental to NAUI’s strength and preeminence within the diving community.
Desire alone does not ensure NAUI leadership certification. The training is a challenging process of growth and self-discovery; receiving your NAUI certificate will be a noteworthy success. It will mean that you have performed to the very limit of your ability, and that you are committed to doing so throughout your career as a diving leader.

The Membership Agreement you will be asked to read and sign when you join is an example of how seriously NAUI members take their responsibility to maintain the Association’s reputation and high quality service to divers and students. It asks you to grant our Membership Review Committee the right to investigate and recommend disciplinary action if you do not behave professionally as a member and abide by NAUI’s Code of Ethics. You will be expected to follow and support the collective will and mind of the membership as expressed in our Standards and Policies Manual. This obligation also includes, however, the freedom to define how to best fulfill leadership responsibilities and develop your own professional style and teaching methods. Members’ individuality and unique contributions are highly valued.

### 1.3. <a name='NAUILeadershipTraining'></a>NAUI Leadership Training

The primary goal of NAUI leadership training is to help you become a valuable member and as successful a diving leader as you can be. This training has four aspects:

1. Acquiring diving knowledge and developing the ability to perform and demonstrate specific essential water skills.
1. Learning leadership skills and developing an effective personal leadership style through study and the observation of other leaders.
1. Benefiting from evaluation and coaching on all aspects of leadership responsibilities.
   Gaining experience through exercising leadership skills under the supervision and guidance of a NAUI Instructor.

### 1.4. <a name='DevelopingLeaders'></a>Developing Leaders

No one can make a leader, but there are traits associated with the display of leadership. Training can help you identify and develop these traits within yourself. Once identified and understood, it will be your responsibility to nurture these qualities as you progress in leadership training throughout your career as a NAUI member and professional diver. NAUI leadership training will give you the tools that will enable you to develop your own techniques for working more effectively with divers, but you will develop your leadership ability in accord with your own personality, values, and style.

### 1.5. <a name='PersonalLeadershipStylesandValues'></a>Personal Leadership Styles and Values

Our conscious behavior is based upon our values and personality. Value (the worth that we ascribe to anything) derives from what we learn by observing our families, friends, culture, and world experience as filtered through our personalities. Personality is the sum of our talents, predisposition and experiences. We learn a great deal by observing the behavior of others, some of which we adapt to our personal style. But, as we evolve and become more confident and mature, we also reject some behaviors as unsuitable and undesirable.

Attitudes (how we feel about things) govern our behavior. The development of an appropriate system of values and proper leadership attitudes is as vital to meeting membership responsibility as the acquisition of knowledge and skills.

The process of leadership training is a continuation of your development as an individual. You will learn that observation, reflection, insight, and realization are as important to the process as study. You will become your version of a leader through a process of assimilation, adapting and modifying everything you learn. Some facets of your trainers’ leadership styles may impress you. Some of their techniques will be valuable as examples of effective leadership skills. However, not all of their styles or techniques may work for you. More important than picking up “tricks of the trade” is working in a leadership program that will show you how established members meet their leadership responsibilities.

Like all NAUI leaders, you will regularly deal with the lives and well being of students and divers. You must develop an attitude that places concern for their safety at the highest level. Minimally competent divers are urged to improve in the same way that NAUI leaders are charged to constantly improve their own competence. Published minimum standards of achievement are treated as goals to be acquired and exceeded. NAUI leaders find satisfaction and enjoyment in inspiring divers to develop well beyond the minimum standards.

### 1.6. <a name='NAUIValuesofLeadershipandInstruction'></a>NAUI Values of Leadership and Instruction

#### 1.6.1. <a name='SuperiorLeadershipandInstructorTraining'></a>Superior Leadership and Instructor Training

NAUI and its members are committed to providing the highest quality leadership and instructor training possible. Embracing the tenets of over-learning, maximizing individual potential, public speaking, developing personal best aquatic skills, minimum and no impact environmental activism, and learning by doing consistently produces the best graduates.

#### 1.6.2. <a name='DemocraticAssociationofEquals'></a>Democratic Association of Equals

The democratic process in regular elections determines the Association’s leadership, its Board of Directors. Each instructor earns the privilege to cast one vote for a fellow member that he or she believes can best serve the Association. Because we all have the same right to directly influence the organization and no individual voting member exercises more or less than a single vote, each member’s views are equally important. The right to vote carries with it a responsibility and obligation to stay informed about Board of Director candidates and engage in the election process.

#### 1.6.3. <a name='TrustandRespect'></a>Trust and Respect

Superior leadership and instructor training are founded in the “Loved One” concept. That is, it is only those we would trust to train our loved ones to dive that we graduate at any level and especially so for leadership and instructor certification. This basis allows us to collectively trust members to behave ethically and respect their abilities as NAUI leaders and educators.

#### 1.6.4. <a name='AcademicFreedom'></a>Academic Freedom

Trust and respect are necessary for members to exercise a most cherished and fundamental right of educational leadership – the freedom to meet the academic needs of their students. NAUI members are encouraged to explore and thereby discover new and innovative ways to help each individual student, as well as divers they lead and teach meet certification requirements – and further to share those discoveries in the Association publications so that other members may benefit.

#### 1.6.5. <a name='DynamicGrowingBodyofKnowledgeandSkills'></a>Dynamic Growing Body of Knowledge and Skills

Exercising academic freedom and sharing resulting discoveries is a celebration of members’ imaginations. It also leads to ever improving training producing better generations of graduates with each completed course. This directly contributes to and renews our organization’s vitality and relevance to the diving industry in which we compete.

#### 1.6.6. <a name='EverImprovingLeadershipandInstructorTraining'></a>Ever Improving Leadership and Instructor Training

These dynamics produce perpetually improving leadership and instructor training courses as conducted by NAUI Instructors, Instructor Trainers, and Course Directors, who incorporate discoveries and new methodology. The outcome is superior leadership and instructor training and curricula of excellence that benefit the Association, the diving industry and global public all the while furthering the pursuit of the corporate mission.

### 1.7. <a name='TheNAUIMission'></a>The NAUI Mission

To promote, through quality education, the techniques necessary for the general public to participate safely in underwater activities, and to educate those people in the preservation and protection of our underwater environment throughout their diving careers.

Becoming a member of the National Association of Underwater Instructors is more than just joining a group with a reputation for quality. It is about embracing a set of values that transcend the mundane pursuit of a vocation. It is about becoming filled with a passion to achieve one’s personal best and helping other to achieve the same. It is about contributing to something larger than oneself and making the world a little better for having passed this way. NAUI members care deeply about diving, the aquatic environment and the safety of people who participate. You have chosen to accept a challenge that can be one of the most rewarding of your life and last an entire lifetime.

## 2. <a name='LeadershipFundamentals'></a>Leadership Fundamentals

### 2.1. <a name='Introduction-1'></a>Introduction

Effective leaders are excited about their jobs, welcoming the challenge that responsibility entails. They are able to reassess, reevaluate, and adjust to changing demands, adapting to situations to provide responsible guidance and support. And their competence and proficiency build group confidence.

The best leaders carefully plan and train for their roles, and are organized and punctual. Forethought helps them do their jobs professionally, consistently performing at their best. Participants in these leaders’ activities know what to expect and that contingencies have been anticipated, allowing them to relax and concentrate on their own goals.

Leaders regard difficult tasks as challenges, but the most able leaders understand, as well, that people live within their own personal limitations. Developing the maturity to face such limitations, without accepting them as excuses for failure, is a mark of true leadership character. Failures do not discourage leaders. They use them to strengthen their resolve to overcome and to learn from them. Others’ failures are treated with compassion and assistance.

### 2.2. <a name='NAUILeadership'></a>NAUI Leadership

The decision to seek NAUI leadership training begins with personal motivation – the will to act on ambition. The reasons vary by individual, but all who earn NAUI membership share the Association’s goals of promoting safer diving, helping the sport grow, and working to preserve the diving environment. They value excellence in these endeavors and find personal satisfaction in fulfilling the responsibility for continuing improvement embodied in their NAUI certification.

The unique challenges of diving leadership, however, and NAUI’s dedication to Dive Safety Through Education, place special emphasis on the fundamentals of: knowledge, experience, and ability.

Contact with NAUI leaders has likely given you some insight into this, and into the added realization that each leader embodies a personal set of leadership characteristics. Thus, there is no formula that can ensure your success as a NAUI leader, other than your willingness to strive to be the best you can be.

NAUI leaders are typically dynamic, goal-oriented individuals, and display flexibility and resourcefulness. Such people welcome suggestions for improvement and work hard to build consensus, although never compromising or negotiating matters of safety, conservation, or NAUI standards. Groups respect their judgment and integrity, as well as their conscientious and caring attitude. NAUI members welcome questions as opportunities to educate, not as challenges to authority. They consider other viewpoints, and are open to learning from anyone.

They are notable for their involved objectivity; they simultaneously care about the well being of others, while observing and helping with their difficulties and concerns.
Personal example is one of a NAUI member’s strongest and most reliable communication tools. Despite their position of authority and control, members strive to be polite and reasonable, and work to ensure their personal manner is usually engaging and approachable. They take care in their speech and actions, understanding that even personal grooming will have an effect on other persons’ perception of them as a leader.

The best NAUI leaders seem to have a certain humility about themselves and their achievements. Although one can often identify the leader in a group, it is generally not because the leader wears jacket patches, or demands attention. Rather it’s “just something” about the person’s demeanor and personality that makes their status clear.

Your success as a NAUI leader will depend directly on your efforts to become one. Concentrating on the three concrete aspects that your training – knowledge, experience, and ability – will address and build the necessary foundation.

### 2.3. <a name='Knowledge'></a>Knowledge

Knowledge and the ability to communicate it are fundamental to exercising leadership. NAUI leadership status requires substantial, comprehensive knowledge of the various disciplines of scuba diving, from physiology to physics, mechanics to mathematics.

The high regard NAUI members place on knowledge is further emphasized by the requirement that those who join continue formal training in the fields of diving, diving safety, and the aquatic environment in order to maintain active status.

Knowledge is gained through formal study, practice and experience, but everyone absorbs information in their own way. While some can read and understand difficult concepts or formulae effortlessly, others must sometimes find alternative ways to learn.

### 2.4. <a name='Experience'></a>Experience

No amount of study or your instructor’s communications skill can substitute for actual guided practice– for scuba diving or leadership. Discussing and reading about an activity are not equivalent to participation. Too often people confuse a knowledgeable background with real experience.

The experience you will gain under your instructor’s guidance will increase your knowledge, diving ability, and understanding of NAUI leadership, and help you integrate what you have learned in the past. Your leadership training will also include real responsibilities, as well as simulations and practice scenarios. All will be aimed at giving you experience that will enable you to develop leadership judgment, the ability to make good diving decisions for yourself and others.

Regardless, of past training, you will still make errors during your leadership training. This is perfectly natural, albeit discouraging at times, especially during formal evaluations. The key to dealing wisely with errors is to learn from yours and those of others.

### 2.5. <a name='Ability'></a>Ability

Ability denotes the capacity of an individual to perform a task or demonstrate a skill. NAUI training will help you acquire and refine leadership-level practical abilities, develop good technique, and the know-how to assess and correct flaws in others’ diving skills.

Whatever certification level we hold, our status as NAUI members makes us highly visible and influential. Divers closely observe, and many seek to emulate all of our behavior, as well as diving competence. You must be able to meet this role model responsibility for the divers you will lead. More subtly, and perhaps ultimately more important, personal attributes and character will determine your success at developing this ability in your pursuit of leadership certification.

## 3. <a name='WorkingasaNAUIMember'></a>Working as a NAUI Member

### 3.1. <a name='Introduction-1'></a>Introduction

NAUI leaders are in demand in every recreational diving setting around the globe. They work full-time year-round, part-time, evenings, weekends, and seasonally. They are self-employed or employed at local clubs and dive stores, colleges, dive resorts, and summer camps. They live and work in exotic locales, aboard cruise liners, luxury yachts, research vessels, and in their hometowns.

The NAUI leadership role you are considering, or for which you are training, can be your entry to an exciting new life-style; or it may provide you with an expanded and rewarding dimension to your regular activities. The choice is yours as a NAUI Assistant Instructor, Skin Diving Instructor, Divemaster, or Instructor.

Dues paid NAUI leaders are all members of the Association, and have the right to display their leadership credentials. Each year, members are notified of annual dues and renewal requirements, and must comply in order to maintain their desired status – active, sustaining, or emeritus. Through the strength of our Association, members may obtain liability insurance appropriate to their certification level and status.

### 3.2. <a name='NAUILeadershipTrainingPhysicalRequirements'></a>NAUI Leadership Training Physical Requirements

NAUI leadership training is a mentally and physically challenging process. All NAUI leadership candidates must have had a recent physical examination by a physician familiar with the demands of diving. The purpose of this exam is to help ensure that trainees face no undue personal risk or pose a risk to others by entering NAUI training and that they will likely be able to adequately discharge their responsibilities to help other divers when certified as NAUI leaders. NAUI leadership includes many physical tasks beyond swimming and diving ability. Helping students or divers through surf or currents, for instance, or having to render assistance or rescue divers when the need is apparent are basic leadership tasks.

While NAUI supports the policy of achieving consensus and respects the opinions of physicians, the final decision authority on an individual’s ability to participate in training courses or serve in a leadership position lies within our organization. When you become a NAUI leader, you will engage in the same fitness evaluation process with every individual with whom you work. Responsible diving leadership includes making certain that participants understand and fully assume the risks of their participation before a training or supervisory commitment is made.

### 3.3. <a name='NAUILeadershipPositions'></a>NAUI Leadership Positions

Each NAUI leadership position entitles holders to certain rights and privileges as a member, and each has different levels of appropriate activity and responsibility. All leadership roles demand adherence to NAUI’s Standards and Policies, and require superior ability and commitment to NAUI’s high ideals of professional and personal conduct.

As a NAUI member, you will be considered a role model for divers and students with whom you work. Fulfilling the responsibility to inspire and lead divers demands maturity, honesty, competence, judgment, ability and tact, and your personal commitment to add to NAUI’s reputation. Consider the impression your behavior will make, and realize that it will reflect upon all members of our Association, no matter what leadership role you perform.

### 3.4. <a name='TheNAUIAssistantInstructor'></a>The NAUI Assistant Instructor

A NAUI Assistant Instructor is qualified to help train skin and scuba divers under the direct supervision of an active-status NAUI Instructor. Although assistants are not permitted to teach skin or scuba diving independently, formally evaluate students for certification or assume sole responsibility for a diving class or students without an instructor present, they perform many valuable services in all phases of NAUI dive training.

Assistants enhance individual development and group safety, as well as-extend an instructor’s span of control by exercising additional vigilance, and can often alert instructors to students’ needs before they become problems.

Like all NAUI leaders, assistant instructors too must have superior water ability, and “demonstration quality” skills. They are frequently called upon to demonstrate proper techniques to dive students at an instructor’s request. Additionally, they must be completely prepared to serve as rescue divers, providing emergency assistance appropriate to their training.

Most assistant instructors aspire to become NAUI Instructors, and serving as an assistant is the most valuable “on-the-job training” available for this goal.

Assistant instructors certification, like all NAUI leadership ratings, carries great responsibility and commands respect in the diving community.

### 3.5. <a name='TheNAUISkinDivingInstructor'></a>The NAUI Skin Diving Instructor

A NAUI Skin Diving Instructor is qualified to independently teach and certify skin diving students, and may register graduates for skin diver certification credentials upon their meeting current NAUI standards. Scuba-certified skin diving instructors may also serve as assistant instructors during NAUI scuba courses, subject to the same activity limitations as other qualified assistants. Skin diving instructors may not teach scuba diving on their own.

NAUI Skin Diving Instructors have the opportunity to promote underwater enjoyment and aquatic conservation to a much wider audience than scuba alone can reach, and can significantly contribute to NAUI’s mission.

### 3.6. <a name='TheNAUIDivemaster'></a>The NAUI Divemaster

A NAUI Divemaster is qualified to organize and supervise dives for certified divers, and may also assist NAUI Instructors during certification training.

While Divemasters may neither teach courses nor issue diving certifications, they have a wide area within which they can gain personal rewards and contribute to NAUI’s mission. NAUI Divemasters are authorized to conduct NAUI Recognition Programs for certified divers, and award recognition materials, including cards and certificates.

Divemasters frequently pursue diving careers as activity leaders or underwater guides. While directing recreational diving activities in virtually every imaginable setting, NAUI Divemasters regularly deal with certified individuals from every agency and every part of the world.

Their main role is to promote, plan, organize and conduct recreational diving activities for certified individuals and groups.

### 3.7. <a name='TheInstructorPath'></a>The Instructor Path

Many individuals enter leadership training with the eventual goal of becoming NAUI scuba instructors. Earning a NAUI leadership position is fundamental preparation for a NAUI Instructor Training Course (ITC). As an instructor you are the key to the success of most diving businesses who need well-trained motivated students and divers to be enthusiastic and satisfied customers.

A NAUI Instructor certification presents limitless opportunity. Post instructor training and continued personal development is also an option after gaining some teaching experience.

## 4. <a name='Divemastering'></a>Divemastering

### 4.1. <a name='Introduction-1'></a>Introduction

NAUI Divemasters organize and oversee dives for certified recreational divers. Enjoying challenging work in every facet of recreational diving, divemasters wield great influence and can do much to help divers make better decisions about their diving activities.

Divemasters may operate as independent dive professionals or serve as diving staff members at schools, universities, dive stores, or clubs. They can plan, organize, promote, and lead local and vacation dive excursions in any of these situations. Divemasters assisting NAUI Instructors are considered “qualified” assistants for staffing ratios as detailed in the NAUI Standards and Policies Manual. Regardless of their actual position, divemasters are NAUI leaders in every sense; highly responsible individuals whose training qualifies them to render assistance in any diving incident. Divemasters may have to “save” a dive with spare gear, timely advice, or counseling, or if called upon in a diving emergency, may literally save a diver’s life.

### 4.2. <a name='ADivemastersAuthority'></a>A Divemaster's Authority

NAUI Divemasters regularly assume serious responsibilities overseeing divers, although they are neither “dive bosses,” nor “diving supervisors.” The authority of a NAUI Divemaster is usually grounded solely in the diving community’s respect for NAUI, and for the individual’s evident competency as a highly-trained, expert diver.

#### 4.2.1. <a name='Duty'></a>Duty

Like all NAUI leaders, divemasters are professionals rather than recreational divers. In particular divemaster certification means having earned the qualifications to assume independent leadership. This can imply responsibility for peoples’ lives. Such status in some areas of the world carries the legal duty to conduct professional activities in a proficient, responsible manner. This includes making a proactive commitment to maintaining and enhancing one’s personal diving and rescue skills and leadership ability through practice, regular continuing education, and professional development.

#### 4.2.2. <a name='Responsibility'></a>Responsibility

NAUI Divemasters rely on their own judgment, experience, and professionalism when assuming direct responsibility for certified divers. Because of the broad scope of recreational diving activities in which divemasters operate, NAUI Standards do not specify how many divers a divemaster can manage. The answer to this question for each diving situation depends upon many factors. Some of the variables are:

- The training and experience of the participants.
- The dive site, environmental conditions, and weather.
- The demands of the planned diving activity.
- The number and quality of people assisting.
- Personal knowledge of the participants and their diving abilities.

This wide latitude confers a correspondingly high obligation for NAUI Divemasters to exercise sound, conservative judgment. The maximum number of participants for any activity must be based on how many divers can be reasonably handled with the level of care expected of a NAUI leader. Thus, the most important element in deciding what constitutes a reasonable number of divers is the actual level of ability the divemaster brings to each unique situation. There will obviously be times when anyone would recognize they need help, and there will be other situations that are more equivocal. Judgment gained through NAUI leadership training and experience helps divemasters analyze situations, assess risks, and respond appropriately.

Safety and professional responsibility are the ultimate criteria for all NAUI diving activities. This can sometimes mean dividing groups and staggering dive times to reduce the number of people in the water at any given time or advising less accomplished divers against participating. Though correct, such decisions can be unpopular or financially detrimental. Despite these consequences, a divemaster’s greatest satisfaction comes from knowing that the last diver in any group has safely exited the water.

### 4.3. <a name='DivemasterSkills'></a>Divemaster Skills

NAUI Divemasters must be highly accomplished divers and extremely effective leaders. Possessing excellent personal diving ability, “demonstration quality skills,” rescue training, and comprehensive diving knowledge are only the beginning characteristics. Divemasters must work to develop their “global awareness” and superior judgment. This should be augmented with outstanding communication skills in order to help divers avoid problems through individual counseling, fostering safety through achieving group consensus and managing risk. Simple but important techniques like remembering people’s names and being able to put them at ease can help divemasters direct activities without seeming overbearing. Also important is the ability to concentrate on the goal of safer diving and get along with people, despite disagreement or even dislike.

Divemasters must be expert at diving in the conditions in which they work. They should also be familiar with the accepted practices for activities in which divers with whom they work may engage, whether or not they participate themselves. They should also be familiar with most diving equipment. They may need additional training in specialized areas such as technical diving, air compressor operation and maintenance, breathing gas cylinders, and filling/gas blending equipment. They may even need to become qualified equipment technicians or marine mechanics to be effective in some jobs.

All divemasters will find good planning, organizational skills, and record-keeping ability important to their role, especially if operating independently. As NAUI members, divemasters can take advantage of a variety of educational benefits available through their local NAUI Representatives, Service Centers, and the Association.

### 4.4. <a name='AssistingDivers'></a>Assisting Divers

NAUI Divemasters, working independently or as assistants, must be able to:

- Conduct pre-dive briefings that incisively cover hazards and risk avoidance.
- Conduct appropriate pre-dive equipment checks.
- Help divers perform weighting/buoyancy checks.
- Help divers prevent or resolve problems.
- Guide certified divers at the surface and underwater.
- Effectively manage or personally respond to diving emergencies.

Clearly, the most difficult and important of these tasks is acquiring and maintaining the knowledge and ability necessary to competently assist a distressed or injured diver. The proper response to any situation will be dictated by a rapid on-site assessment, and all divemasters must be mentally and physically prepared to determine and render appropriate aid. To be able to do this, they must commit to learning and repeatedly practicing emergency response skills throughout their careers.

#### 4.4.1. <a name='OrganizingandAssemblingDivers'></a>Organizing and Assembling Divers

A great deal of a divemaster’s leadership effort goes into the simple logistics of organizing and assembling divers. Much of this takes place before a diving event. Directions for rendezvous, travel arrangements and costs, departure and return times, necessary lodging and meal recommendations, and any particular documents or fees, such as for area admissions, boat rides, or equipment rental should all be communicated to participants well in advance. Divemasters are also usually responsible for imparting site information, such as any “house rules” for boats, beaches, or other areas and conducting dive briefings and debriefings at the event.

#### 4.4.2. <a name='RecordKeeping'></a>Record Keeping

Divemasters should maintain good records of diving activities they conduct. It is required that such records be kept for a period of five years. This includes the dive rosters, activity and personal information – such as names, certification levels and agencies, addresses, ages, emergency contact, and medical insurance information – for all participants.

While divers should be advised to maintain their own records of diving activities, they often depend on the divemaster log as a source of post-dive information that they can then transcribe to their personal log. Divemasters are also frequently asked to sign logbooks as witnesses. They are strongly advised to read such items carefully before signing and to refrain from endorsing questionable or incomplete entries.

#### 4.4.3. <a name='EquipmentandProcedures'></a>Equipment and Procedures

Divemasters should develop checklists of mandatory and recommended equipment for diving activities. The divemaster’s goal should be to ensure that divers are equipped to safely enjoy the dive.

### 4.5. <a name='BeingaDivemaster'></a>Being a Divemaster

Since no two diving experiences are exactly the same, only considered judgment and experience can guide a divemaster in any specific situation. A helpful, out-going manner and competent leadership behavior at a dive site accompanied by superior ability in the water will help ensure success.

Little details, like having plentiful drinking water available, or distributing fruit or candy to divers after they have unsuited can help a personal reputation, but conducting safe and enjoyable dives is more the issue.

In practice, the divemaster job rarely ends when all the divers have safely exited the water. There are still many clean-up and other tasks that need attention. These can include checking in rental equipment, filling cylinders, organizing and collecting weights, maintaining gear, developing photos, washing down the boat, and virtually anything else that needs doing. Divemasters are likely among the first to arrive at every dive event, and often the last to leave. In resort areas, it is often said that divemasters work “from dawn till done.”

Divemasters are vital to NAUI’s success and are important contributors to safer diving.

## 5. <a name='PreparingforanITC'></a>Preparing for an ITC

### 5.1. <a name='Introduction-1'></a>Introduction

Completing the NAUI leadership training progression and becoming an instructor is a thrilling challenge. Certification as a NAUI Instructor confers the right to train and certify the public in scuba, and subsequently in specialty areas as delineated in the NAUI Standards and Policies Manual. Instructors are also the only voting NAUI members, directly electing the Association’s Board of Directors, thus contributing to the evolution of NAUI’s guiding principles.

### 5.2. <a name='TheITCExperience'></a>The ITC Experience

ITCs vary in structure from accelerated nine or ten day courses to extended internships spanning a college semester or a full diving season. During the course, candidates are continually taught, tested, and assessed. Regardless of individual background, participants undergo careful evaluation and coaching on the physical and intellectual skills of scuba diving and instruction. During a typical course, swimming, skin and scuba diving skills, as well as academic diving knowledge, teaching techniques, effective public speaking and presentation are all practiced and appraised. Candidates focus on learning how to teach skills and information as well as perfecting “demonstration quality” personal diving skills. All are judged on their proficiency in presenting lessons and supervising others in the water and in a classroom. Attitude, motivation, character, creativity, and resourcefulness contribute to ratings. The process assesses and strengthens candidates’ every mental and physical ability.

### 5.3. <a name='TheMeasureofaNAUIInstructor'></a>The Measure of a NAUI Instructor

Completing prerequisite training courses can best develop the skills, knowledge, and attitudes necessary for success at a NAUI ITC. NAUI’s Master Scuba Diver Educational System is a convenient way to gain or review instructor level knowledge of diving academics. Candidates should also have developed polished, leadership quality diving skills and practical knowledge through extensive diving experience. Once thoroughly prepared, a candidate is ready to gain the most from the ITC. Without thorough earlier training and development, it is extremely difficult to successfully complete an ITC.

Even so, your ITC is only the beginning. Preparing to instruct and being a NAUI Instructor are ongoing processes that last throughout a career. Instructor status, as with other NAUI certifications, is just another step in your development as a diving leader and career as a NAUI member.

### 5.4. <a name='TimeandCommitment'></a>Time and Commitment

Success at a NAUI ITC requires extensive advance preparation, and your strong commitment to achievement. No one becomes a NAUI leader, let alone an instructor, casually. Dedication and commitment to purpose are fundamental to the process. You must be strongly motivated to attain instructor certification.

Sufficient time must be devoted for judgment to develop in an aspiring leader, and to develop the confidence, determination, and attitude you will need to carry you through the experience. Attending an ITC before one is fully ready is usually frustrating and counterproductive. While it is theoretically possible to progress from non-diver to diving instructor in a relatively short time, becoming a skilled leader is the result of an unhurried maturation and a long-term dedication to achieving goals. Individuals must judge their readiness in consultation with their own leaders.

### 5.5. <a name='Mentors'></a>Mentors

If you have participated in the progression of NAUI leadership certification courses, it is likely that you will have acquired a mentor, a trusted counselor or teacher. This individual will have inspired and guided you to the point where you feel ready to begin the process of becoming an instructor. Their wisdom and character should be an example and comfort to you, guiding you in your preparation.

### 5.6. <a name='Experience-1'></a>Experience

Experience is key to success at a NAUI ITC and as a NAUI Instructor. In recognition of this, NAUI Standards require a minimum number of logged dives to qualify for leadership training at each level, as well as minimum participation in NAUI classes.

Acquiring useful experience is seldom easy or free. It takes planning and judgment to select appropriate activities, time, and commitment to complete them, and help to properly evaluate and benefit from them. Training, experience, guided evaluation, and coaching are all elements of preparation that will contribute to your success.

### 5.7. <a name='Diving:QuantityandQuality'></a>Diving: Quantity and Quality

It is the depth of experience, not just the quantity of experience that prepares a person for successful completion of an ITC and for being an effective and capable teacher of divers.

Some NAUI Instructor Trainers and Course Directors recommend making a minimum of 100 dives in addition to dives completed during training before entering an ITC – far in excess of the minimum requirement. They may actually require such experience for entry into their leadership courses. NAUI Standards do not restrict members from establishing prerequisites in excess of published minimums. (These must be communicated to prospective enrollees before beginning training.) By doing so, they are underscoring the value of diving experience, and attempting to ensure their trainees’ success.

Having made 100 or even 1,000 dives at a few sites may not yield as useful experience as would be gained by making the minimum prerequisite dives at different places under varied conditions. However, dive sites needn’t be geographically distant or exotic to yield distinctive experiences. Variety can stem from planning different dive activities and objectives, during different seasons, or at different times of the day or night.

Participating in planning and executing even routine diving activities in a variety of circumstances is invaluable preparation and will increase your competence and confidence. Additionally, seek to vary the environments in which you dive. Experience in fresh and salt water, warm, temperate, and cool climates, and challenging conditions such as low-visibility or currents will further augment your skills and knowledge.

Practice all skills, including underwater navigation and search and recovery during day and night dives. Learn the skills of wreck penetration, deeper diving, and other specialty diving or aspects of technical diving. Experiences like these will prove valuable at your ITC and, more importantly, later, as you practice the craft of teaching diving.

Finally, realize that your goal requires that you don’t just make dives, no matter how many, but rather that you continually gain from them. Use every dive as a chance to perfect your skills, increase your ability and acquire knowledge. Debrief with your dive partner after every dive. Aspiring to professional diving instructor status requires professional level concentration on every dive.

### 5.8. <a name='SupervisedDivingExperience'></a>Supervised Diving Experience

Diving under supervision with specific training goals usually results in quality experience and increased diving acumen. Express your leadership ambition to individuals supervising any activities in which you participate. Regardless of their professional affiliation, most active diving leaders will be happy to provide feedback on your skills. Use such feedback (even from dive vacations or pleasure dives) to focus your pre-ITC preparation. The most profitable blend of supervised diving in formal training with recreational experience should be determined in consultation with your NAUI mentor.

### 5.9. <a name='ExperienceSupervisingandTeaching'></a>Experience Supervising and Teaching

Gaining experience supervising divers is just as important as your personal diving competence. Working with a NAUI Instructor is the single most effective way to develop adequate supervisory competence in preparation for a NAUI ITC. Earning certificates to teach other personal safety courses, such as CPR and First Aid, and conducting these classes, is good training for a potential NAUI Instructor and will make you more valuable when you are certified to teach scuba.

### 5.10. <a name='LeadershipWaterSkills'></a>Leadership Water Skills

No candidate without excellent diving skills can be successful at a NAUI ITC. In its most basic sense, “water skills” describes “demonstration quality” performance: comfortable, seemingly effortless skin and scuba diving.

NAUI leadership courses require participants to develop proficiency in a variety of general and diving-specific water skills. Current requirements are detailed in the NAUI Standards and Policies Manual, but they can be divided into various broad categories:

#### 5.10.1. <a name='Category1:SwimmingSkills'></a>Category #1: Swimming Skills

These are the basic swimming and assistance skills required for entry into a NAUI leadership course. They are performed without any scuba or skin diving equipment in a confined water environment.

#### 5.10.2. <a name='Category2:SkinDivingSkills'></a>Category #2: Skin Diving Skills

These require equipment: at least a wet suit jacket, a weight belt adjusted for proper buoyancy, mask, fins, snorkel, and BC. They may be performed in confined or suitable open water.

#### 5.10.3. <a name='Category3:ScubaDivingSkills'></a>Category #3: Scuba Diving Skills

These are performed in suitable confined water, wearing a complete scuba unit in addition to appropriate skin diving gear. Like the other categories, preparing to complete the scuba skills required for evaluation is a process of:

1. Breaking complex performances into component parts.
1. Practicing the parts under supervision that includes corrective review.
1. Becoming completely comfortable with each part through repetitive practice.
1. Polishing your performance to “demonstration quality.”

### 5.11. <a name='PreparatoryTraining'></a>Preparatory Training

Your success in a NAUI ITC will be directly related to the amount of leadership ability you have acquired through experience and formal training. Prior certification, and especially field activity as a NAUI Assistant Instructor, Skin Diving Instructor, or Divemaster is the best type of preliminary training you can get. By progressing up the certification ladder, continually refining your knowledge and ability as you learn from professional NAUI Instructors, you will learn about leadership.

### 5.12. <a name='Academics'></a>Academics

It is a NAUI tenet that we strive to know more than we teach. NAUI Instructors regularly help others develop an understanding of the practical applications and effects of various scientific principles related to recreational diving. Instructors must be able to effectively tutor in disciplines as diverse as the basic computational skills needed for dive planning to foster an understanding of basic cardiopulmonary function. All such instruction is aimed at the level needed to help divers and students make better diving decisions and minimize their potential risk while learning and diving.

It is therefore necessary to gain the skills necessary to teach in scuba-specialized areas of academics. Your ITC will help you develop teaching ability, but it is important that you be prepared in advance to make the most of the instruction you will receive.

## 6. <a name='PlanningandOrganizingDives'></a>Planning and Organizing Dives

### 6.1. <a name='Planning'></a>Planning

Every diver has heard the axiom:

> Plan your dive; dive your plan.

Its corollary for diving leadership is:

> If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.

Planning helps minimize the chance for errors by anticipating variables that might affect the event’s success. It includes deciding what needs to be done in every eventuality and how best to do it. Some of these are best accomplished well in advance, while others may be modified at the moment. They all affect one another and contribute to a dive’s success.

### 6.2. <a name='PrincipalStepsofPlanning'></a>Principal Steps of Planning

- Decide objectives.
- Recognize staff and student or diver needs.
- Identify equipment requirements.
- Schedule location, date, and time.
- Gather information.

#### 6.2.1. <a name='EstablishingObjectives'></a>Establishing Objectives

The first step in planning a supervised activity is to review the dive’s objectives, bearing in mind that the primary objective is always safe and enjoyable participation by all.

#### 6.2.2. <a name='OrganizingStaff'></a>Organizing Staff

Staffing first means identifying what roles must be filled to accomplish the dive’s objectives, and engaging people qualified to assist. Leaders must be able to judge the ability of their support personnel, motivate them and utilize them effectively. Staff must understand that they are expected to act professionally and are assuming responsibilities under the leader’s direction. The ultimate responsibility for the actions of diving staff rests with the leader in charge of the activity.

Certified assistant instructors, divemasters, skin diving instructors, or leadership trainees helping with instruction should realize that the responsibility for planning is the instructor’s, but their involvement can be mutually beneficial. They will learn a great deal from the instructor, and most NAUI Instructors will recognize that assisting staff can provide helpful reminders and suggestions.

#### 6.2.3. <a name='IdentifyingEquipmentRequirements'></a>Identifying Equipment Requirements

While all dives will require certain equipment in common, some activities require specialized gear. Acquiring and checking these items and ensuring that staff is familiar with their function and use are important parts of planning. Specialty training dives, technical dives, research dives, and night dives, for example, each require some unique equipment.

#### 6.2.4. <a name='SchedulingtheActivity'></a>Scheduling the Activity

Scheduling often identifies uncontrollable problems or timing conflicts. These may be minimized with forethought, but the best plan can fail due to natural or accidental circumstances. Variables such as weather, site conditions, engine breakdown, and the like can all have effects.

Whenever possible, an alternate dive site plan should exist in case the primary choice is somehow unsuitable. There will, however, be days when the only good choice is to postpone an activity. Leaders should have an alternate day scheduled, and divers should know if this possibility exists in advance. The contingency plans in these cases should include the possibility of refunds or future credit. Also consider that if the target dive location is a known to be unpredictable and alternative locations are not an option, it may be wiser to promote the excursion as a “great day at the beach” with scuba diving as a bonus – conditions permitting.

### 6.3. <a name='EvaluatingDivingConditions'></a>Evaluating Diving Conditions

Leaders need to learn about weather, water conditions, and temperature at chosen dive sites. The best way to obtain accurate information about a planned diving area is to combine research with an advance visit. Short of an extra visit, leaders should plan to arrive at sites well in advance of participants to “scout.” If you must escort the group, talk to other leaders and divers who have been to the site recently.

### 6.4. <a name='KnowingDiveParticipants'></a>Knowing Dive Participants

Learning as much as possible about the people with whom one will be diving is important to effective leadership. NAUI leaders who have participated in a scuba class, for instance, will have grown familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of students before scheduling training dives, and can plan more efficiently. They will also have the benefit of having established their credibility and competence in the minds of participants. Such familiarity can help reduce student anxiety. No open water training dives should be conducted unless leaders are certain that students have received sufficient training to participate with minimal risk.

Informal interviewing is an essential communication skill that makes planning and leading dives with unfamiliar people easier. Finding out about people’s prior dive experiences and training in a conversation is easy, but learning about how they feel about the current situation requires subtlety and time. NAUI leaders who frequently work with strangers should plan this time into their normal schedule. At a minimum, consider allowing enough time to review a person’s dive log or have a brief, one-on-one conversation before entering the water.

### 6.5. <a name='PlanningforEmergencies'></a>Planning for Emergencies

Gathering information on appropriate emergency equipment and qualified emergency aid providers is part of every NAUI member’s planning process. Leaders planning diving excursions to remote areas should inform participants in advance of the risk any lack of emergency treatment facilities may potentially create, so that they may make an informed decision on their participation.

Medical insurance and emergency contact information should be compiled from all participants. This can include a document granting permission to the NAUI member to initiate emergency treatment and activate local medical services in case a diver is unconscious.

NAUI leaders would also be wise to urge participants to acquire diving medical insurance that will cover the costs of evacuation, recompression therapy and other medical treatment, transportation home, and hospitalization.Gathering information on appropriate emergency equipment and qualified emergency aid providers is part of every NAUI member’s planning process.

### 6.6. <a name='OrganizingStaffandParticipants'></a>Organizing Staff and Participants

Diving leaders must always confirm that there are sufficient staff available to properly conduct a diving event. Staff must be involved, organized, and assigned various responsibilities before the start of any activity. Staff positions may include an Activity Leader, Activity Divemaster, Dive Team Leaders, and various assistants. Roles are frequently combined, depending on the location, activity, group size, and participants’ experience. Larger groups and training activities usually require proportionally more staff.

Participants should be made aware of staff members’ responsibilities and certification status. If uncertified trainees or non-leadership personnel are in staff positions, their roles especially should be clearly outlined to participants.

#### 6.6.1. <a name='ActivityLeader'></a>Activity Leader

The Activity Leader, usually an active-status instructor or divemaster, takes overall responsibility. The Activity Leader often initiates the activity through a class, or is put in charge by a store, club, or other diving services provider. To make the best use of available talent, an Activity Leader must recognize that different staff duties require different strengths. Concurrently, the Activity Leader must be ready to assume any staff role.

#### 6.6.2. <a name='ActivityDivemaster'></a>Activity Divemaster

The Activity Divemaster is responsible for maintaining the dive roster, taking roll, monitoring surface activities, advising participants, directing emergency response procedures, and working toward the efficient realization of the dive plan.

Activity Divemasters should be certified divemasters or instructors with the ability and experience to monitor all dive activities.

#### 6.6.3. <a name='DiveTeamLeader'></a>Dive Team Leader

Grouping divers into teams is an efficient method of organization for activities with a large number of participants, such as found in resort settings or aboard weekend dive charter vessels. A team will usually consist of more than one buddy group. A designated Dive Team Leader (DTL) who serves as the teams’ representative should direct each team. DTLs should be familiar with the dive site, the divers, and the diving activity.

There are many factors to be considered when assigning divers to teams: the planned activity, diver capabilities, equalization problems, physical ability, anxiety levels, and even domestic partner pairing. Every effort should be made to avoid forming dive teams with more than one marginal diver. Whenever possible, spread out less-capable divers among the teams so no one dive team has more than one diver who may require more than normal attention.

#### 6.6.4. <a name='QualifiedAssistants'></a>Qualified Assistants

When student numbers are too large in dive classes, qualified assistants may be used to create manageable dive teams or to bring student-instructor ratios within NAUI standards. A “qualified assistant” is an individual who has completed a designated NAUI course and registered with NAUI.

### 6.7. <a name='BuddyTeams'></a>Buddy Teams

NAUI supports buddy diving as a routine practice and aid to safer diving. It is practiced in all NAUI training activities. An Activity Leader will definitely face liability problems in case of any mishap that might be even remotely attributed to the lack of a buddy if the buddy system was not endorsed and used when conducting dive(s).

During recreational diving, Activity Leaders or Activity Divemasters encourage certified divers to select their own buddies. Though the two-person buddy team is most common, some diving specialty activities such as cave or wreck penetration may be best done in three-person teams. In training, NAUI Instructors must assign or approve students’ buddy choices.

### 6.8. <a name='MotivatingDivers'></a>Motivating Divers

Motivating divers usually involves helping them to behave in their own best interests. NAUI leaders are generally best able to motivate divers by a combination of “show and tell.” Remember that actions are based on attitudes that are based, in turn, on values: people ascribe worth to certain ideas and act accordingly. Remember, as well, that much behavior is learned by observing others and leaders are, by their position, highly visible. We can extrapolate from these ideas the two main motivational tools NAUI leaders can use:

1. Educating divers about our values and attitudes, fostering understanding and compliance through respect for knowledge;
1. Behaving in an exemplary professional manner that supports NAUI’s commitment to safe diving and environmental conservation.

### 6.9. <a name='RulesPoliciesandRegulations'></a>Rules, Policies, and Regulations

Establishing and communicating clear guideposts for appropriate conduct is an important part of planning successful diving activities and essential to effectively motivating divers. Such guides can be divided into three distinct categories, each of which can be of particular use to NAUI leaders.

#### 6.9.1. <a name='Rules'></a>Rules

Rules can be established by anyone, and violations are commonly understood to have consequences. They are especially useful for maintaining order, and reinforcing learned behavior if they are:

- Reasonable
- Explained
- Understood

Agreed to by those affected.

Instructors often use rules with constructive consequences to aid teaching and reinforce learning.

#### 6.9.2. <a name='Policies'></a>Policies

Policies are established procedures based on wisdom, knowledge, or good judgment, and are designed to facilitate or expedite some goal. They define the usual courses of action an individual or organization will follow or the conditions under which performance will occur. Policies should reflect prudence and appeal to reason and logic. Violations may generate social or personal disapproval, and/or violators may not be allowed to continue their participation until they conform to policies.

Leaders can exercise discretion in setting the rules and policies for their activities. In fact, the NAUI Standards and Policies Manual is an example of policies. NAUI leaders voluntarily agree to abide by them while conducting leadership activities in order to remain members in good standing and continue to receive the benefits of the Association.

#### 6.9.3. <a name='Regulations'></a>Regulations

Regulations are laws established by duly empowered authority. Compliance is not voluntary and punishments are prescribed for violations. Examples are U.S. Coast Guard regulations or city, provincial, state, and county laws, fish and game or environmental conservation laws or traffic codes. NAUI leaders are obligated to know and obey the laws that affect diving, should ensure that participants understand them, and should encourage compliance. NAUI members do not, however, enforce regulations; this job is reserved for authorized law enforcement personnel with legal jurisdiction.

NAUI leaders must insist upon lawful behavior and should not tolerate lawbreaking. Divers who break the law should be told they have and discouraged from continuing. If necessary, report offenders to the authorities.

### 6.10. <a name='Enforcement'></a>Enforcement

Like motivation, the primary enforcement methods available to NAUI leaders are effective education and their own behavior. By following rules and policies themselves and helping divers understand why such guides exist, NAUI leaders can gain cooperation. As with other potential diving problems, the best course of action to avoid enforcement issues is to anticipate and prevent them. Leaders are advised to make sure that divers understand requirements in advance, have the opportunity to discuss them, and thus make an informed choice about their participation.

One method of doing this is to have divers sign a “Statement of Understanding” when signing up to participate in any NAUI activity. A sample statement of understanding and enrollment agreement is available to be downloaded via NAUI’s website.

If a rule is violated, it is usually best to tell people immediately. Restate the management importance and tangible benefit of following the rule and request cooperation from that point on. Difficult though this may be, if the Activity Leader does not enforce rules and policies, they will soon become meaningless and of no value in controlling the group.

Always try to avoid confrontation or embarrassment. Keep discussion of infractions neutral, informative and focused on the objectionable action, not the person’s character or behavior. Tact, diplomacy, and humor will often defuse tension that can result from efforts to regulate behavior.

### 6.11. <a name='Preparation'></a>Preparation

Preparation includes preparing final briefings for staff and participants and otherwise ensuring that everything from gear to people is ready. Two excellent ways to prepare are with the use of checklists and by distributing fact sheets and printed instructions. Checklists are extremely useful memory aids for diving leaders, staff, or divers (samples for dive briefings and debriefings are contained in the NAUI Risk Management Handbook). Fact sheets help avoid misunderstanding and reduce repetitive questions.

Another excellent preparation technique is to get participants together at an advance meeting to set the ground rules for the activity. If people know what is expected of them beforehand, the activity will be much better organized, and it will be much more likely that everyone will arrive on time with everything they will need. The type of diving experience being organized will help determine what type of meeting and response to expect.

Leaders should organize their personal items and diving equipment, the dive support equipment, spare parts, extra gear, and emergency equipment well before any planned event. It is wise to use a checklist that inventories and indicates all necessary equipment has been inspected and tested. Replace parts or repair any items as needed and pack carefully. Encourage divers to take the same action with their own gear.

Additional preparation tasks include making a written briefing outline for the activity, preparing rosters, including possibly one on a waterproof slate, copying any required forms, compiling emergency contact information, and making final confirmation phone calls to ensure that the emergency telephone numbers you have are current and working.

One of the most important results of careful preparation is increased confidence for all. Participants with organized and complete information will be more confident in their ability to cope, and they will be much more confident in the ability of a thorough, organized leader. Relaxed, confident divers and leaders will enjoy the event more, and carefully planned, well prepared activities are much more likely to proceed without mishap than unprofessional, ad hoc affairs.

## Conducting Diving Activities

### Introduction

Whether in charge as a divemaster or instructor or assisting another leader, conducting safe, enjoyable dives is a basic goal and primary activity of NAUI members.

### Overseeing Dives

While it would be impossible to detail the specifics of every possible combination of divers and situations, there are some basic precepts that NAUI leaders can apply in overseeing most dives.

In the Glossary of the NAUI Standards and Policies Manual “Overseeing” is defined as:

> “The overall control, intermittent supervision, evaluation, and direction of instruction, student skill performance, and diving activities by a NAUI Instructor of a class or group of students. The instructor must be present at the training site prepared to direct and render appropriate in-water assistance in aid of a student.”

This in contrast to the definition of “Direct Supervision,” which is:

> “Supervision by the NAUI Instructor of the class or group of students from a distance allowing immediate intervention on behalf of the student. It is the level of supervision required while evaluating student performance of skills required for certification.”

These definitions help distinguish between supervising NAUI students during their initial scuba diver training experiences and subsequent experiences during which greater responsibility for dive conduct is transferred from instructors to students. Such transfer necessarily alters an instructor’s supervisory role from being able to immediately intervene to being present and ready to respond with aid to those in need.

### Awareness

Accepting NAUI leadership responsibility means that one fully commits to responding to divers’ needs and helping ensure their safe enjoyment of diving. “Global Awareness,” the term used to describe the absolute concentration NAUI members use to support that commitment, is a combination of experience, judgment, and knowledge. More than simply watching, such awareness is based on continuously observing divers and dynamically assessing conditions, equipment, and the full range of other variables that contribute to a dive’s success.
